Tell us what you think
We want to hear views from as many people as possible and we want it to
be easy for you to tell us what you think.
How to comment
Please comment online via our website, www.greatercambridgeplanning.org. If you have
difficulty commenting online, or you need information in a different format, please let us know
and we will be happy to assist.
All comments must be received by Monday 13 December 2021 at 5pm.
There are different ways to comment to suit who you are and what you would like to tell us.
We are also holding a webinar on how to comment, and how we will take comments into
account during the next stage of plan development.
Quick comments:
■   Tell us your views about the big issues and main sites in the plan using our quick
    questionnaire. This is anonymous, so if you represent a group, organisation, developer
    or landowner, we recommend you do not use this survey and that you use the detailed
    comment process below.
Detailed comments
■   Comment on individual policies or site proposals, in the full digital Plan on our
    consultation system. This requires you to login (or register if you are not already a user).
    It allows you to leave longer comments and add attachments, and it means we can get
    in touch with you if we have any questions. You can comment on all or just some parts of
    the Plan.
■   We have provided a downloadable Word document to assist you in preparing detailed
    responses, but please do not email this to us – please input your responses using the
    online system.
■   Please do not email us comments or documents, as we will have to manually enter
    them into the consultation system and ascribe them to policies or sites. This will
    potentially mean that we will spend a longer amount of time processing responses to the
    consultation. If you have difficulty using our online system, please contact us to discuss
    alternative methods for submitting your comments.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
1. About the Plan
1.1        What is the Greater Cambridge
           Local Plan?
Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council (referred to as ‘the
Councils’ in this consultation) are working together to create a joint Local Plan for the two
areas – which we are referring to as Greater Cambridge. This will ensure that there is a
consistent approach to planning, and the same planning policies, where appropriate, across
both areas.
A Local Plan is a legal document that the Councils are required to prepare, which sets out
the future land use and planning policies for the area over a set time frame. It identifies the
need for new homes and jobs, and the services and infrastructure to support them, and
guides where this development should happen.
In the past the Councils have produced separate Local Plans, but with a shared development
strategy, including a number of development sites straddling the administrative boundary.
This time we intend to prepare a single Local Plan for both council areas. We committed
to do this when we signed up to the City Deal in 2014, which will bring in up to £500m over
a 15-year period from central government towards transport and infrastructure projects
managed by the Greater Cambridge Partnership.
Both Councils adopted their current Local Plans in 2018. These included a commitment to an
early review, in particular to update the assessment of housing needs, to review the progress
of delivering planned developments including new settlements, and to consider the needs
of caravan dwellers and government changes to the approach to planning for Gypsies and
Travellers. When adopted, the Greater Cambridge Local Plan would replace both Council’s
2018 Local Plans. The adopted 2018 Local Plans remain in force until they are replaced.
Local Plan preparation follows a process set out in national legislation and guidance and
is independently tested at a public examination to check it is ‘sound’ – this means that it is
realistic, deliverable and based on good evidence – before it can be formally adopted.
Local Plans are key in making decisions on future planning applications in the area,
alongside national planning policy and other supplementary guidance.

1.2      How does  it fit with  other  plans  and
         strategies?
Figure 1: Greater Cambridge in the wider region
Our new Local Plan needs to be prepared within a wider regional context. We have a legal
duty to cooperate with key stakeholders and surrounding areas on strategic cross boundary
issues. You can find more information in our Duty to Cooperate Compliance Statement and
Statement of Common Ground.
We work closely with bodies like the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority,
who are the Local Transport Authority responsible for preparing the Local Transport Plan for
the county, and Cambridgeshire County Council, who are responsible for a range of issues
such as education.
At a very local level, Neighbourhood Plans continue to be prepared in Greater Cambridge. At the
time of writing there are four plans which have been prepared and endorsed by communities,
which now form part of the statutory development plan for the area. A number of villages are
producing plans, and you can find out more on our neighbourhood planning website.
                                                                             13

The Oxford-Cambridge Arc
Greater Cambridge sits at the heart of several economic corridors: the Oxford-Cambridge Arc,
the UK Innovation Corridor (London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough) corridor and
the Cambridge-Norwich Tech Corridor.
The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is a globally significant area including the counties between
Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge, identified as a key priority by the government.
The ambition for the Arc is to build a better economic, social and environmental future for the
area. There is an opportunity to make the Arc an even more beautiful place to live, work and
visit, by making high-quality, well-connected and sustainable communities.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
An Oxford-Cambridge Arc Spatial Framework is being prepared which will provide a long-
term strategic plan to help coordinate the infrastructure, environment and new developments
in the area up to 2050. When finalised it will become part of government planning policy
alongside the National Planning Policy Framework.
The Government held a 12 week consultation which closed on 12 October 2021 seeking
views on the vision for the Arc. The Government plan to follow this with further consultations,
on policy options in Spring 2022, and the draft spatial framework in Autumn 2022 prior to its
final publication in 2023.
We do not know the outcome of the Oxford-Cambridge framework at this point. We hope that
by developing our own clear and positive vision for the future of the area we will be able to
shape the proposals.
1.3        Our plan-making journey
Figure 3: Timetable for the Greater Cambridge Local Plan
The diagram above shows the outline timetable that is included in the adopted Greater
Cambridge Local Development Scheme. The Local Development Scheme is a document
we are required to produce which sets out our plan making timetable. At each stage we
will check that the process is moving forward positively towards a new Local Plan and, if
necessary, we will adjust the timetable.
Our plan making journey started back in 2019 with a series of workshops with elected
members, residents’ groups, landowners/developers, and other stakeholders about issues
and themes that would be important to the Plan.
In early 2020 we held a six week public consultation called the First Conversation. This set
out issues under seven themes, and posed a series of questions about how they should be
addressed in the new Local Plan. During the consultation period, extensive outreach and
communications activities took place in order to engage our communities as fully as possible.
This included using social media to spread awareness of the consultation, pop-up events
across the area, and the Big Debate event that we held at the Cambridge Corn Exchange.
                                                                                      15

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
We received a large amount of feedback through the various communication channels. In
July 2020 we published the feedback and comments we received, and the full results can be
found on the Greater Cambridge Shared Planning Service website. This included all the site
suggested to us through the ‘call for sites’ which formed part of the consultation.
In November 2020 we published the findings of initial expert assessments of a range
of broad spatial locations and growth level options. You can read the findings, including the
Development Strategy Options Summary Report, in the Document Library. We also held
another series of workshops with key stakeholders to explore these findings.
We have produced a Consultation Statement which provides more information on the
consultation we have carried out so far, and how we have taken feedback into account. We
will update this at each stage of plan making.
1.4       The purpose of the First Proposals
          stage
The First Proposals stage is the next major step in our plan making journey. It sets out
our preferred approach to the level of growth that should be planned for, and where it
should be planned. It also highlights that there remains uncertainty about delivery of water
infrastructure needed to support new growth, and how this could impact on the timing of
developments proposed.
It describes the planning policies we propose to prepare that would shape development and
guide planning decisions. It sets out why we have identified these approaches against the
alternatives available.
The purpose of the consultation is to invite responses to these proposals from residents and
businesses as well as stakeholders and other organisations. We want to hear your views
before we develop the approaches into detailed planning policies. In particular we would like
your feedback on:
■  The emerging development strategy
■  The direction of travel for policies
■  Issues we should be considering as policies are prepared
In legal terms, this consultation forms part of our consultation under Regulation 18 of the
Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
1.5        What happens after the First
           Proposals stage?
We hope to receive a wide range of feedback, including from individuals, communities,
businesses, academic institutions and stakeholders during this consultation on the options
identified. All the comments received during the consultation will be analysed and a summary
report produced and published on our websites.
This feedback will be invaluable as we start to draft the Local Plan itself.
We are still working on and refining evidence to inform the draft plan. This process will
continue over the coming months. This includes further consideration of water resource
availability to support the delivery timetable of the developments proposed, and the potential
implications for the plan. More information on this can be found in the strategy section.
Our current Local Development Scheme sets out that in 2022 we will publish the draft
Local Plan and all evidence supporting the plan for public consultation, allowing people to
comment on the fully detailed policies and allocation proposals. We will keep this timetable
under review and this may be revised dependent on a number of factors including evidence,
comments received through consultation, progress on key infrastructure and the Oxford-
Cambridge Arc spatial framework.
The later stages of the timetable may also depend on the timetable of the Development
Consent Order proposals for the Cambridge Waste Water Treatment Plant Relocation
Project. This is because we need to have evidence of whether the North East Cambridge
proposals (see Strategy, S/NEC) that form a key part of the development strategy are
deliverable, so we will need to understand the outcome of this process.
In 2024 the Councils expect publish the plan they intend to submit to the Secretary of State
for adoption. Representations made at that stage will be considered by the independent
Inspector at an Examination of the plan. The inspector will prepare a report, and consider if
the plan is sound and can be adopted.
This process may be affected by changes to the planning system being considered by the
government. They published a White Paper in 2020 called Planning for our Future which
proposed significant changes to what local plans would cover and how they would be
prepared. We do not yet know the outcome of this consultation.
Further updates of the timetable will be published on our website in our Local Development
Scheme.
                                                                                       17

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
1.6        The structure of the new Local Plan
Our Local Plan must provide a positive vision for the future of Greater Cambridge. The
aim is simple: to ensure sustainable development. Sustainable development has three
strands - social, economic and environmental. It means meeting the needs of the present
population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. To
properly reflect the three strands of sustainable development, we must plan for homes, jobs
and supporting infrastructure (transport, utilities, services and facilities) in the right places,
alongside protecting and enhancing the environment. In order to achieve this, we will need to
balance many competing priorities and issues.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
In the First Conversation we proposed that the plan be structured around four ‘big themes’
that will influence how homes, jobs and infrastructure are planned. We received lots of
feedback on all of these, but the majority of respondents supported the approach. We
therefore continue to use them to shape the plan.
In addition to the themes, the First Proposals consultation includes the strategy that the plan
is proposing, which has been influenced by all of the themes and sets out the development
strategy and the proposed policies and sites that are proposed to meet our needs in Greater
Cambridge to 2041 and beyond.
1.7       Evidence informing the new
          Local Plan
Preparing a Local Plan requires gathering the appropriate level of evidence to inform the
preparation of the plan, as required by national policy.
In November 2020 we published initial
                                      evidence
                                                base
                                                      ﬁndings
                                                               and
                                                                    development
                                                                                   strategy
options assessments. This evidence explored a range of broad spatial locations and growth
level options.
A range of further evidence studies have now been published to accompany the First
Proposals consultation. These can be found in the Greater Cambridge Local Plan First
Proposals Document Library.
Sustainability Appraisal
A key role of the planning system is to contribute to sustainable development. Each stage
of plan making will be accompanied by a Sustainability Appraisal. The aim of this process
is to test the options and policies being considered by identifying potential positive and
negative social, economic and environmental impacts, and highlighting opportunities to
improve the plan.
As part of the First Conversation we consulted on a Scoping Report, which sets out our
approach to the appraisal of the plan, along with an initial Sustainability Appraisal of the
Issues and Options identified. Comments on these documents have been taken into account
and responded to.
The First Proposals have been subject to sustainability appraisal, and this has been
published to accompany the consultation. This explores the sustainability of the preferred
options in the First Proposals and reasonable alternatives. We would welcome comments on
the Sustainability Appraisal as part of this consultation.
                                                                                       19

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
2. Greater Cambridge in 2041
Our vision
■   We want Greater Cambridge to be a place where a big decrease in our climate impacts
    comes with a big increase in the quality of everyday life for all our communities. New
    development must minimise carbon emissions and reliance on the private car; create
    thriving neighbourhoods with the variety of jobs and homes we need; increase nature,
    wildlife and green spaces; and safeguard our unique heritage and landscapes.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Our Plan takes inspiration from what is unique about our area, and embraces the bold new
approaches that will help us achieve this vision.
Our aims
Our aims for this plan are:
■  Climate change: Help Greater Cambridge transition to net zero carbon by 2050,
    by ensuring that development is sited in places that help to limit carbon emissions, is
    designed to the highest achievable standards for energy and water use, and is resilient
    to current and future climate risks.
■   Biodiversity and green spaces: Increase and improve our network of habitats
    for wildlife, and green spaces for people, ensuring that development leaves the natural
    environment better than it was before.
■   Wellbeing and social inclusion: Help people in Greater Cambridge to lead
    healthier and happier lives, ensuring that everyone benefits from the development of new
    homes and jobs.
■   Great places: Sustain the unique character of Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire,
    and complement it with beautiful and distinctive development, creating a place where
    people want to live, work and play.
■   Jobs: Encourage a flourishing and mixed economy in Greater Cambridge which
    includes a wide range of jobs, while maintaining our area’s global reputation for
    innovation.
■  Homes: Plan for enough housing to meet our needs, including significant quantities of
    housing that is affordable to rent and buy, and different kinds of homes to suit our diverse
    communities.
■   Infrastructure: Plan for transport, water, energy and digital networks; and health,
    education and cultural facilities; in the right places and built at the right times to serve our
    growing communities.
These aims expand on the themes for this plan, and have informed decisions regarding the
spatial strategy, and future policies. We have aligned these aims with the principles in the
National Planning Policy Framework, and the Greater Cambridge Local Plan Sustainability
Appraisal objectives.
                                                                                       21

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
2.1       How much development, and where?
Figure 4: Illustrative map showing locations of proposed new housing development
2020-41
Greater Cambridge has a strong and nationally important economy. Over recent years, jobs
have been created faster than new homes have been built, and this has contributed to higher
house prices and increased commuting into the area. Our new development strategy aims to
meet our increased need for new homes in a way that minimises our environmental impacts
and improves the wellbeing of our communities.
We anticipate than an average of 1,771 homes per year will be built in our area during
the Plan period. Our evidence shows that we need to plan for about 550 more homes per
year in order to meet our need for housing. Our strategy proposes 19 additional sites for
development, along with sites already in our adopted 2018 Local Plans, in order to meet
this housing need. Alongside this we will plan for the business space, supporting community
facilities, green spaces and infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing communities.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
We propose to direct development to where it has the least climate impact, where active and
public transport is the natural choice, where green infrastructure can be delivered alongside
new development, and where jobs, services and facilities can be located near to where
people live.
Our vision is for the well known characteristics of the historic core of Cambridge to be
complemented by active, compact neighbourhoods – new and old. This means providing
opportunities to regenerate areas that aren’t yet reaching their potential, and creating new
city neighbourhoods which have the critical mass of homes, jobs and services to create
thriving communities, making best use of brownfield and safeguarded land.
Alongside this, we want our new towns to mature into great places to live and work, making
the most of their existing and planned public transport links to Cambridge and other centres.
In the case of Cambourne, East-West Rail means that it will be one of the best-connected
places in our region, and whilst things like the location of the new station are yet to be
resolved, we do think it can develop into a more substantial town with a more fully developed
and lively centre.
We want our rural villages to continue to thrive and sustain their local services, but we don’t
want to encourage lots of new homes in places where car travel is the easiest or only way to
get around. We therefore propose some development in and around larger villages that have
good transport links and services, and to support important employment clusters. In smaller
villages, we’ll continue to support infill development and affordable housing on suitable sites,
but we do not propose lots of village growth.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy S/JH: New jobs and homes
Figure 5: Infographic showing objectively assessed needs, 2020 to 2041
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the level of needs in Greater Cambridge that development will meet
over the plan period of 2020-2041, for jobs, homes, and accommodation for gypsies and
travellers and travelling showpeople.
Proposed policy direction
We propose that the new Local Plan will meet the following objectively assessed needs for
development in the period 2020-2041:
■   58,500 jobs
■   44,400 homes, reflecting an annual objectively assessed need of 2,111 homes per year,
    which is rounded for the plan.
The homes will include all types, sizes and tenures of market and affordable homes, pitches
for gypsy and travellers, plots for travelling showpeople, pitches for others residing in
caravans, and residential moorings. Evidence identifying the requirements for pitches, plots
and moorings will be completed ahead of the draft plan consultation.
The policy will also set out the approach to identifying neighbourhood plan housing targets
for existing or new designated neighbourhood areas. These targets will not form part of
the homes figure to be met by new allocations. Instead, the proposed approach would
apportion a share of the housing windfall figures (considering Cambridge and South
Cambridgeshire separately) according to the neighbourhood area’s share of the relevant
district’s total population.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 11 requires that plans should provide
for objectively assessed needs for housing and other uses. This policy only deals with
housing and employment needs. Policies within the other themes address the critical
infrastructure required to support these homes and jobs, including utilities such as water
and power (Policy CC/WE, I/EI), community, sports and leisure facilities (policy WS/CF),
green infrastructure (policy BG/GI), open spaces (policy BG/EO), and other infrastructure
including transport (policy I/ID).
Jobs and homes
For housing, National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 60 says that Local
Plans should support the Government’s objective of significantly boosting the supply
of homes, providing, as a minimum, the number of homes informed by a local housing
need assessment, using the standard method in national planning guidance. National
guidance says that there will be circumstances where it is appropriate to consider whether
actual housing need is higher than that indicated by the standard method.
For jobs, National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 81 requires plans to support
economic growth and productivity. The continuing strength of the Greater Cambridge
economy and its national importance provides justification for exploring higher employment
and related housing figures. The Centre for Cities (March 2021) describes Cambridge as
one of the most important research and innovation-led employment hubs in the UK. In recent
years, it states, the city started from a strong, well-educated employment base and moved
from strength to strength.
Responding to evidence of recent fast jobs growth and the resulting implications for
housing demand highlighted in the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Independent
Economic Review, we commissioned the Greater Cambridge Employment Land and
Economic Development Evidence Study (November 2020). This Study provides a
detailed understanding of potential future employment change for all jobs in the area,
including exploring the key sectors that drive employment growth in the Greater Cambridge
area. It concludes that the most likely future level of jobs growth, taking into account long
term patterns of employment including recent fast growth in key sectors that perform
particularly strongly in the Greater Cambridge area, is for 58,500 jobs between 2020 and
2041. This was the medium growth level from our strategic options that we published
in November 2020 (called the central level in our Employment Land and Economic
Development Evidence Study).
We consider that we should plan for this forecast of the most likely level of new jobs. We
are however mindful that the Study also identified a higher growth forecast, placing greater
                                                                                      25

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
weight on fast growth in the recent past, particularly in key sectors, and that it suggested
providing flexibility in employment land in case the market delivers more jobs than
anticipated, which is addressed later.
In parallel with the Employment Land and Economic Development Evidence Study we
commissioned the Greater Cambridge Housing and Employment Relationships Report
to understand the relationship between future jobs and housing growth. These studies found
that planning for the standard method housing figure set by government would not support
the number of jobs expected to arise between 2020 and 2041. Planning for this housing figure
would risk increasing the amount of longer distance commuting into Greater Cambridge, with the
resulting impacts on climate change and congestion.
We consider that our objectively assessed need for housing for 2020-2041 is the number
associated with the most likely future level of jobs: this is a figure of 44,400 homes. This
assumes that all the additional homes generated by forecast jobs above those supported by
the Standard Method will be provided in full within Greater Cambridge.
Our housing and jobs evidence are based upon pre-COVID-19 data. We know that
COVID-19 is continuing to have a very significant impact on many aspects of our lives,
including on where and how we live and work, and that this is likely to have implications
for long term planning. However, at this time it is very difficult to estimate the long-term
effects. We have considered at an initial high-level the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the
economy of Greater Cambridge, to inform this First Proposals consultation. Evidence will be
prepared to consider the potential longer-term quantitative impacts of COVID-19 prior to the
Draft Plan stage to ensure that we understand any implications for the objectively assessed
need for jobs and homes for the plan.
In establishing the amount of housing to be planned for, national policy requires us to take
into account any needs that cannot be met within neighbouring areas, as well as needs
arising in Greater Cambridge. At this point in the plan making process no neighbouring
authorities have asked us to consider taking some of their housing need. Equally, we are not
currently asking neighbouring authorities to take any of our own needs.
Gypsies and travellers, travelling showpeople, caravan dwellers
and residential moorings
Greater Cambridge has a large Gypsy and Traveller community. We are required to identify
and plan for the accommodation needs of gypsies and travellers, travelling showpeople,
others residing in caravans and boat dwellers. A Joint Accommodation Needs Assessment
for Gypsies, Travellers, Travelling Showmen and Bargee Travellers and other Caravan and
Houseboat Dwellers has been commissioned with authorities in Cambridgeshire and parts
of Norfolk and Suffolk. The outcome has been delayed by COVID-19 lockdowns and social

distancing measures, and the study is now expected to report at the end of 2021. The draft
plan stage will identify the number of pitches and plots, and residential moorings, that we will
be planning for, and how we will meet that need.
Neighbourhood Plan housing targets
National policy requires that Local Plans should set out a housing requirement for
designated neighbourhood areas – places where communities are actively preparing
neighbourhood plans. We currently apply the proposed approach on an informal basis
to identify indicative housing requirements for designated areas, and we propose to
formalise this approach by including it within the Local Plan. This proposed approach sees
neighbourhood plans contributing to meeting the number of homes we expect to come
forward across the area during the plan period on windfall sites – sites not specifically
identified in the local plan - and provides local communities with the opportunity to
influence where such development goes. As such we are not relying on neighbourhood
areas providing additional homes to meet our requirement.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
A majority of responses (49%) to the relevant First Conversation question (Q32) agreed that
we should plan for a higher number of homes than the minimum required by government,
to provide flexibility to support the growing economy. Views varied with some stating
that we should plan for no new development, and others stating that we should plan for
government’s standard method local housing need, and others for higher figures. Many
comments highlighted the potential negative impacts of growth, but also that if development
is to come it needs to mitigate its impacts on issues such as climate and biodiversity, in
particular by the location and design of development.
Discussion during the Autumn 2020 workshops considering the Strategic Spatial Options
evidence identified that there is general consensus about there being a strong relationship
between homes and jobs. Views varied between those stating that we should plan for no
or low growth, and those stating we should plan for the higher jobs growth scenario. Many
stakeholders raised concern that the maximum growth levels forecast could be undeliverable
due to the issues with water supply across Greater Cambridge. It was acknowledged that
delivery of the water infrastructure required to prevent further deterioration of local chalk
aquifers was potentially a ‘deal-breaker’ within the timescales of the Local Plan.
In the First Conversation consultation we also asked for comments on the then proposed
approach of planning to 2040. Most responses supported this approach, with some
suggesting a longer end date of 2050. Some comments queried the then proposed start date
of 2017, which had been derived based on the availability of historic data at the time of the
First Conversation. The First Proposals includes a plan period of 2020-2041, bringing the
                                                                                      27

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
start date to a point now reflecting the latest data, and an end date of 2041 to ensure we
meet the national policy requirement for plans to look ahead over a minimum 15 year period
from adoption.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Planning for the higher jobs forecast and level of homes associated with it. This alternative
was rejected as this higher jobs forecast could be possible, but is not the most likely future
scenario. As such we do not consider that it represents our objectively assessed need, and
would therefore not be a reasonable alternative.
2. Planning for the government’s standard method local housing need figure. This alternative
was rejected as it would not support the most likely forecast for future jobs. As such we do
not consider that it represents our objectively assessed need, and would therefore not be a
reasonable alternative. Failure to reflect that likely level of growth, would lead to increased
commuting into the area (with consequent impacts on quality of life, wellbeing and carbon
emissions objectives for the plan).

Figure 6: Map showing proposed sites to be included in the Plan
What will this policy do?
Set out the proposed strategy for the pattern, scale and design quality of places created in
Greater Cambridge, not only for the plan period but beyond to 2050. It will set out where the
homes and jobs identified in S/JH: New Jobs and Homes should be provided, in order to
meet the vision and aims of the Local Plan.
Proposed policy direction
The proposed development strategy for Greater Cambridge is to direct development to
where it has the least climate impact, where active and public transport is the natural
choice, where green infrastructure can be delivered alongside new development, and where
jobs, services and facilities can be located near to where people live, whilst ensuring all
necessary utilities can be provided in a sustainable way. It also seeks to be realistic around
                                                                                     29

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
the locational limits of some new jobs floorspace which is centred upon national and global
economic clusters.
We propose to reinforce the distinctive character of our city, towns and villages through
developing sites that can be well-integrated with existing communities. Using less land for
development reduces our carbon emissions, and allows more space for nature and wildlife,
so we propose that sites should be developed at densities, and using appropriate forms
and patterns of development, which make best use of land while creating well-designed,
characterful places.
The proposed development strategy takes up opportunities to use brownfield land and
responds to opportunities created by proposed major new infrastructure. We propose
to meet our housing and jobs needs by taking account of existing planning permissions
alongside a limited number of new sites in the most sustainable locations.
Within the Cambridge urban area our strategy proposes:
■   North East Cambridge – a compact city district on brownfield land already identified for
    development, including a mix of jobs and homes;
■   Smaller new sites for housing and employment well-integrated with existing
    neighbourhoods;
■   Continuing existing sites and areas of major change allocated in the previous plan that
    we still expect to be delivered;
■   Continuing existing opportunity areas and identifying new ones;
■   Windfall development – an allowance for homes on unallocated land, which would be
    consistent with the other policy requirements in the Plan.
On the edge of Cambridge we propose:
■   Cambridge East – a new mixed-use district on the existing safeguarded land at
    Cambridge Airport;
■   Supporting the nationally important Cambridge Biomedical Campus, including through a
    limited release of land from the Green Belt;
■   Using land more effectively at North West Cambridge through intensifying development
    within the existing boundary of the site;
■   The University Innovation District centred on West Cambridge/Eddington – supporting
    the continued development of this area, including encouraging a mix of uses to create a
    vibrant campus;
■   Continuing development at existing strategic sites allocated in previous plans, for
    example at Darwin Green.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
For our new settlements, we propose:
■  Evolving and expanding Cambourne into a vibrant town alongside the development of
   the new East West Rail station, which will make it one of the best connected and most
   accessible places in the area; and
■  Continuing development at the new settlements of Northstowe, Waterbeach and Bourn
   Airfield allocated in previous plans – including faster housing delivery rates at the new
   towns of Northstowe and Waterbeach, so that more homes are provided by 2041 without
   an increase in the overall amount of development proposed.
We propose some development in the rural area south of Cambridge, the Rural Southern
Cluster, where homes and jobs can be located close to each other and served by good
quality public transport, cycling and walking links, including:
■  Employment and tied housing at the Wellcome Genome Campus expansion – confirming
   the existing planning permission;
■  Additional employment at Babraham Research Campus, through releasing the Campus
   and a modest area of additional land from the Green Belt;
■  New smaller sites for housing and employment in villages that have very good public
   transport access and are close to jobs, some of which are through release of land from
   the Green Belt; and
■  Continuing allocations for existing sites allocated in previous plans;
In the rest of the rural area, we propose a very limited amount of development:
■  Small new sites for housing and employment at villages that have very good public
   transport access, to help our rural communities thrive;
■  New employment sites in the countryside meeting specific business needs; and
■  Windfall development - an allowance for homes on unallocated land, which would need
   to be consistent with policy requirements in the Plan, including Policy SS/SH: Settlement
   Hierarchy, which sets out scales of development in different categories of village.
Consistent with the new National Planning Policy Framework, our vision for Greater
Cambridge looks not only to the plan period of 2041, but well beyond to 2050, reflecting that
significant development identified in our strategy will continue beyond the plan period from
the range of strategic sites identified, including the new settlements.
In order to provide greater confidence that the identified housing needs in Policy S/JH New
Jobs and Homes can be met, and that a continuing supply of housing can be demonstrated,
we are proposing to allocate enough sites to provide approximately a 10% buffer so we have
the flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances. We also propose to provide flexibility
in the amount and type of employment land supply to help enable the Greater Cambridge
economy to continue to flourish.
                                                                                      31

of new homes to plan for
S/JH New Jobs and Homes identifies the needs over the plan period. It is then for the
Councils to decide how to meet those needs and the amount of development to plan for.
National planning policy requires us to ensure our plan is positively prepared and meets
our identified housing needs. This includes meeting the government’s Five-Year Housing
Land Supply requirement throughout the plan period and also the Housing Delivery Test,
which in turn look ahead at ensuring adequate future supply and backwards at past delivery.
This is important as if we fail either of those tests at any point in the future, the Councils
would have less control over development that comes forward in planning applications for
sites that are not proposed in our plan. For homes, in order to give greater confidence in
meeting our needs, and in line with good practice, we propose to plan for approximately 10%
more homes than our objectively assessed needs, a total of around 48,840 homes.
For jobs, our Greater Cambridge Employment Land Review & Economic Development
Evidence Base (2020) identified that of the 58,500 overall jobs anticipated over the plan
period, around 20,000 of those would be office and industrial jobs, and it converted those
into employment floorspace needs of almost 416,400sqm. The rest of the jobs forecast are
in services and support uses such as shops, schools and healthcare. It recommends that
to ensure a flexible employment land supply for office and industrial jobs, and encouraging
growth in existing businesses and attracting inward investment, we plan for a greater amount
of employment floorspace than that associated with our identified need, taking into account
the needs of different employment sectors.
Identifying how much new land for jobs and homes needs
to be found
Our adopted 2018 Local Plans, which identified a number of large sites for development on
the edge of Cambridge, and major developments like Northstowe and the new town north of
Waterbeach that will continue to build out for many years to come, including in some cases
beyond the new plan period, mean that a large proportion of the development we need to
plan for in the Greater Cambridge Local Plan has already been identified.
For jobs, we have a considerable amount of employment land already identified, and there
is over 600,000 sqm of employment floorspace in our supply. However, this includes some
large employment sites, such as the Genome Campus, that are expected to continue to build
out well beyond the new plan period in a similar way to identified land for new homes on
some of the large sites. This has been the case over many years, even with the fast rate of
growth in some of the key sectors in Greater Cambridge area recent years. Our employment
                                                                                      33

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
evidence identifies that notwithstanding the overall level of employment land supply, there
is a need for suitable new land to be identified to meet the employment needs of specific
sectors – some of which have very specific locational requirements.
For homes, we already have almost 31,500 homes in our adopted Local Plans or with
planning permission set to be delivered by 2041. On top of this, we have identified
an allowance for windfall sites for residential development coming through planning
applications. For Greater Cambridge as a whole we expect about 5,300 homes to be
built during the plan period from this source. We also have the equivalent of just over
400 homes either allocated in our adopted plans or with planning permission anticipated
to be provided in the form of bedrooms for students or older people. Subtracting existing
commitments and our windfall allowance from our housing need, whilst incorporating
a flexibility buffer of approximately 10%, results in a balance to find in new allocations
between 2020 and 2041 of 11,640 homes. The sites set out in this preferred option plan
would meet those residual needs.

The Cambridge economy
Greater Cambridge hosts internationally significant clusters of Life Science, ICT and
Professional Services and Advanced Manufacturing businesses. Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough’s Digital Sector Strategy (2019) describes Greater Cambridge as being at the
area’s heart as an unparalleled centre of technological innovation. In 2019, Cambridge had
308.7 patents per 1,000 of the population, the most in the UK and more that the next three
cities combined. The success of the Life Science sector in Greater Cambridge, built on the
knowledge and expertise of Cambridge University and world leading research institutes,
has been characterised by both the growth of indigenous businesses and the investment of
internationally renowned businesses such as Astra Zeneca who have chosen to locate here.
These knowledge-based clusters are key to Greater Cambridge’s role as the engine for
economic growth. The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Independent Economic Review
(CPIER) says: “A distinguishing feature of [Cambridgeshire and Peterborough] is how
strongly it has grown recently… This has been driven primarily, but not entirely, by rapid
business creation and growth in the south – Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire.”
The Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development Evidence Study
(November 2020) (ELR) explores the characteristics of each key economic cluster including
the challenges and opportunities that they currently face.
Life Sciences (including healthcare, biotechnology and biomedical activities): The ELR
confirms that Life Science cluster in Greater Cambridge continues to grow with a need for
                                                                                      35

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
additional research and development laboratory space identified. Businesses are looking for
flexible workspace where new and growing businesses can locate and, with time, expand.
Life science companies tend to prefer to cluster together and close to research institutes
and, in some cases clinical medicine, in order to benefit from the exchange of ideas,
information, resources.
ICT (including digital technology and artificial intelligence) and Professional Services
(including traditional business services and knowledge activities related to research and
development not captured otherwise): The ELR reports that in recent years Cambridge has
become a major employment centre for ICT taking advantage of academic research, industry
collaboration and the skills of local residents. The outlook for the sector is considered to
be positive but there is a need for additional floorspace with challenges for new and small
businesses in finding flexible quality units.
Advanced Manufacturing (the making of physical products, often a critical feeder service to
other sectors): The ELR report expected sustained incremental advanced manufacturing
growth as it is linked to supplying other growth sectors, notably life sciences. Advanced
manufacturing is varied and takes many forms and may include light industrial floorspace, but
also office space and, in some cases, laboratory space. More generally, there is a need for
multi-purpose buildings - sometimes with either industrial, laboratory or storage floorspace on
the ground floor and office floorspace used for administration on the floor above.
The emerging Local Plan proposes a range of new employment space which together with
the existing allocations that we are carrying forward, will support our key economic clusters,
ensuring we provide a good range in the type, size and location of sites that respond to the
needs of businesses as identified in our evidence. For example, new sites at Babraham
Research Campus and the Cambridge Biomedical Campus will provide additional space
for life science businesses to cluster and grow. ICT and professional services businesses
will have the opportunity to locate to North East Cambridge as well as a range of other sites
within new and existing communities across Greater Cambridge. At Cambridge East we will
be looking to ensure that the site’s manufacturing legacy is not lost, and we are proposing to
allocate additional space for manufacturing close to the Swavesey junction on the A14. This
allocation would also cater for the need for warehousing businesses which provide important
support to all of our key sectors. Providing a healthy supply of land for business use should
also help ensure land is affordable for all business sectors, including those which cannot
afford higher cost space.
Spatial strategy
National planning policy says that plans should set out “an appropriate strategy, taking into
account the reasonable alternatives, and based on proportionate evidence”.
The adopted development strategy for Greater Cambridge in the 2018 Local Plans continued in

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
broad terms the strategy set out in the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Structure Plan 2003 and
the previous local plans. The joint strategy within the separate 2018 Local Plans includes:
■   Development within Cambridge where there was capacity
■   Carrying forward existing edge of Cambridge allocations, identifying limited additional
    development on the edge of Cambridge where this would not cause significant harm to
    Green Belt purposes, and safeguarding land for development at Cambridge Airport
■   New Settlements at North of Waterbeach and at Bourn Airfield, alongside carrying
    forward the existing allocation at Northstowe
■   Extension of Cambourne at Cambourne West
■   Limited Village allocations at Rural Centres and Minor Rural Centres
Delivery of the adopted strategy is progressing well, with development underway or
completed at all stages of the development strategy, including at the edge of Cambridge
sites, at the new settlement sites of Northstowe and Waterbeach New Town, at Marleigh
north of Cambridge Airport and at Cambourne West, and with outline permission granted for
Bourn Airfield New Village and Land North of Cherry Hinton.
Figure 9: Location of currently consented and allocated development pipeline 2020-2041
In considering the strategy choices available for the new Greater Cambridge Local Plan we
explored the sustainability merits of locating development within each of the five sources of
supply from the adopted development strategy, comprising Cambridge urban area, edge of
                                                                                       37

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Cambridge (both non-Green Belt and Green Belt land), new settlements and villages. We
also identified four new development strategy choices not considered for previous plans,
which form geographically focused hybrids of the previously identified sources of supply,
comprising Public Transport Corridors, providing homes close to jobs in the research parks
to the south of Cambridge, integrating development with planned infrastructure in the
corridor to the west of Cambridge, and a hybrid involving release of land from the Green
Belt. We reviewed the sustainability merits, opportunities and constraints for each of these
nine potential strategy choices, considering evidence under each of our themes, as well as
completing Sustainability Appraisal of them.
Alongside considering the best locations for new homes and jobs, we have also been
considering the best locations to restore our area’s habitat networks and provide more green
spaces for people providing health and wellbeing benefits. Our Green Infrastructure evidence
has identified 14 strategic green infrastructure initiatives to help achieve this. We have prepared
our preferred development strategy including draft allocations and green infrastructure initiatives
in parallel. See BG2: Green Infrastructure for more detail on each initiative.
Drawing on our evidence and consultation feedback, our preferred option is a blended
strategy to meet a variety of needs, and respond to the opportunities provided by the sources
of supply. It is strongly influenced by:
■  Reducing climate impacts through compact development located to connect homes and
   jobs and where active and sustainable travel can be maximised
■  Making best use of suitable safeguarded and brownfield land
■  Making best use of existing and committed key sustainable transport infrastructure
■  Supporting rural communities to thrive and sustain services
Our evidence and Sustainability Appraisal confirm that the urban area of Cambridge remains
a highly sustainable broad location for additional homes and jobs, relating to its accessibility to
existing jobs and services. A number of existing allocations are proposed for retention in this
broad area. Beyond this, North East Cambridge provides the most significant development
opportunity in this area. Given the very detailed assessment that informed the 2018 Cambridge
Local Plan and that a number of allocations have yet to be implemented very limited new
smaller allocations have been identified, whilst several new opportunity areas for regeneration
have been identified alongside carrying forward those that have yet to come forward.
Our evidence shows that the edge of Cambridge could be a sustainable location for homes
and jobs, being accessible to existing jobs and services, and if development is planned at
sufficient scale this could also support new infrastructure. A number of existing allocations
on the edge of Cambridge continue to be built out. Beyond this, on the edge of Cambridge
outside the Green Belt, Cambridge East provides the most significant development
opportunity in this area, comprising land at Cambridge Airport that was originally identified
for development in the 2003 Structure Plan and is safeguarded in the 2018 Local Plans for

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
development should the site become available, which the landowner has now advised will be
the case by 2030. There is also opportunity for additional homes within the built area of the
existing site being built in North West Cambridge at Eddington.
We do not consider that our housing needs alone provide the ‘exceptional circumstances’
required in national policy to justify removing land from the Green Belt on the edge of
Cambridge in this Local Plan, having regard to the identification of the proposed emerging
strategy that can meet needs in a sustainable way without the need for Green Belt release.
We have therefore considered sites on the edge of Cambridge in the Green Belt individually
to assess whether there could be any site-specific exceptional circumstances that could
justify release of land from the Green Belt. In all but one case we do not consider that such
exceptional circumstances exist. However, we do think that it may be possible to demonstrate
that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a limited release of Green Belt at Cambridge
Biomedical Campus to provide an opportunity to improve the sustainability and qualities of this
unique international campus and to allow it to continue to grow into the future.
Our existing new settlements at Northstowe, Waterbeach and Bourn Airfield will continue to
be built out through the new plan period to 2041 and beyond, and form a significant part of
our future supply. We don’t think that further new settlements should be allocated. The most
sustainable location for strategic scale development away from Cambridge is to expand on
existing development in the Cambourne area, taking advantage of the significant benefits
that will be provided by the proposed East West Rail station as well as the improvements
already anticipated from the Greater Cambridge Partnership’s Cambourne to Cambridge
scheme. This significant improvement in public transport provides an opportunity to grow
an existing new town, enhancing the critical mass of population, employment and services
available locally to those communities.
We also have evidence that locating homes close to existing and proposed jobs at the
cluster of research parks to the south of Cambridge would help reduce commuting and
associated carbon emissions and congestion. We are supporting both jobs and homes
growth in this area, through rolling forward a number of existing housing allocations, and by
identifying new allocations, including for jobs at Babraham Research Campus, jobs and tied
homes confirming the existing planning permission at Wellcome Genome Campus, and a
number of housing sites at well-connected villages in the area.
Our evidence shows that our villages should play only a limited role in meeting future
development needs to support delivery of a range of smaller sites and support the vitality of
our villages. Alongside rolling forward a number of existing housing sites, we have identified
a limited number of new sites for housing at our more sustainable villages. We have taken a
design-led approach to identifying housing capacity at these sites.
In addition to the allocations within the sources of supply listed above, some of which will
include both homes and employment space, we have also identified a number of new
                                                                                        39

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
employment allocations in the rural area to meet the specific needs of different sectors
identified in our employment evidence.
Taking the proposed development strategy as a whole, with the new allocations proposed in
this section, the First Proposals for the new Local Plan propose a total of 11,590 new homes
(rounded down), which is broadly consistent with the number we were aiming to identify
approximately 11,640, which represents our housing need plus a 10% buffer.
National planning policy says at least 10% of our housing requirement should be
accommodated on sites no larger than 1 hectare, unless it can be shown that there are
strong reasons why this cannot be achieved. The site commitments we have and new
proposals suggested in this consultation, together with windfall sites expected to come
forward would mean we exceed this requirement by some margin. However, if we were to
allocate specific sites it would need us to develop large numbers of sites in the rural area.
This would compromise our development strategy, by directing a significant portion of
growth to less sustainable locations, impacting on our response to the challenges of net zero
carbon, and likely requiring large numbers of Green Belt releases.
The following diagram sets out the broad distribution of housing growth under previous
rounds of plan-making, alongside the preferred option strategy distribution. The proportions
of housing development in different types of location have changed over time as the impacts
of the sustainable development strategy across our current 2018 Local Plans, which was
initiated in the round of plans before, really starts to take effect. The large strategic sites
on the edge of Cambridge and the new settlements in South Cambridgeshire have had
long lead-in times but are now delivering well and starting to make up a larger proportion of
development that is expected to continue through the plan period. The less sustainable rural
area would have a lower share of development in the new plan, whilst still providing some
limited development to help support our rural communities.

                                                        Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
The new National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) says that where a local plan
includes proposals for new settlements, it should set a vision that looks further ahead
than the normal 15 years from adoption of the plan, to at least 30 years. The development
strategy contained in plans for the Greater Cambridge area over many years have contained
new settlements, going back to the original proposals for Cambourne. Each past local plan
has identified new settlements that will continue to build out well beyond the plan they were
first identified in so having a vision that looks beyond the plan period is something that has
long been part of plan making in this area. The new Local Plan supply for the plan period
to 2041 contains 16,725 homes from new settlements in the adopted plans as well as
around 2,000 from new proposals for an expanded Cambourne so approximately 19,000 in
total. However, there will still be approaching 10,000 homes to build out beyond 2041, plus
whatever may ultimately be identified at an expanded Cambourne. The proposed Local Plan
vision reflects the important role of the four proposed new settlements for not only the plan
period but also for the period to 2050. This will be kept under review during the plan making
process, including how it relates to the government’s emerging Oxford-Cambridge Arc
Spatial Framework that will also plan for the period to 2050.
Ensuring a deliverable plan – water supply
Having confirmed our objectively assessed needs for housing and jobs and our proposed
provision, we also have to ensure that the plan is deliverable and that any environmental
impacts can be addressed appropriately.
A key issue identified in the Greater Cambridge Integrated Water Management Study is the
need for new strategic water supply infrastructure to provide for longer term needs, and to
protect the integrity of the chalk aquifer south of Cambridge. The current preferred growth
trajectories put pressure on water resources in Greater Cambridge. Our draft Sustainability
Appraisal also identifies significant environmental impacts if the issue is not resolved.
Water Resources East is currently preparing its Water Management Plan for the region to
cover the period to 2050, expected to be published for consultation in 2022. It is understood
that this will include planning for significant new infrastructure in the form of a new Fenland
reservoir, alongside other measures, to provide water supply that is designed to address both
environmental and growth needs. However, on current timelines this will only be available
to supply water from the mid 2030’s. Until such new strategic resources are delivered,
there are short/medium term risks that ongoing growth will cause further deterioration to the
chalk aquifer and habitats in the chalk streams which flow into Cambridge. The solutions
could lie in measures such as sourcing more water from other locations that do not rely
on the aquifer and seeking maximum efficiency in water use and further reducing wastage
through leakage. This approach could have dual benefits in reducing pressures from existing
development and meeting short/medium term risks until the mid 2030s.
                                                                                         41

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Until more is known about the proposals for water supply that will be contained in the new
regional Water Management Plan, there remains some uncertainty whether water supplies
can be provided in a way that is sufficient for the full objectively assessed needs to be able
to be delivered in a sustainable way throughout the plan period.
It is critical that the key strategic water infrastructure is delivered as soon as possible to
support the government’s economic ambitions. It is an issue for a much wider area than
Greater Cambridge, but our plan is the first to confront the latest issues.
The Councils have been, and continue to, engage with the relevant bodies responsible
for water supply planning, including Water Resources East, the Water Companies and
the Environment Agency to ensure they understand the significance of the issue. We are
taking every opportunity to raise this at the most senior level with all key parties, including
government through its focus on the Oxford-Cambridge Spatial Framework, that will also
have to address this issue.
If it is concluded that it is not possible to demonstrate an adequate supply of water without
unacceptable environmental harm to support development ahead of strategic water
infrastructure being in place, there may be a need for the plan to include policies to phase
delivery of development. A ‘stepped’ housing requirement may need to be explored that
would see development limited to levels that can be supported by a sustainable water supply
until such time as the new strategic infrastructure is in place. Given the need to rely only
on reasonable rates of delivery of homes and jobs, this could mean that it is not possible to
demonstrate delivery of the full objectively assessed needs within the plan period.
As noted above, under circumstances where it would not be possible to demonstrate that
there is a reasonable prospect that the full development needs can be delivered by 2041,
the Councils would have to discuss with neighbours the potential for them to meet that
element of needs under the duty to cooperate, recognising that they may experience the
same regional water issues. It is possible, if this issue cannot be resolved, that ultimately the
Councils may have to put forward a plan that does not demonstrate that needs will be met
and argue through the examination process that it can be found sound.
Clearly the hope is that the water industry, supported by government, will set out its
intentions for positively addressing this key infrastructure issue at an early point in the
ongoing plan making process, to provide confidence that adequate water supply will be
available to support delivery of the preferred options allocations, before the next stage of a
full draft Local Plan.

Duty to Cooperate
In preparing our evidence informing the preferred strategy we have engaged with relevant
organisations under the legal duty to cooperate on plan making, to ensure we have fully
considered strategic cross-boundary matters. The engagement we’ve completed to consider
these strategic issues is set out in our Duty to Cooperate Statement of Compliance, and
our current position on each substantive issue is set out in our draft Statement of Common
Ground. The water supply challenge addressed above is a serious issue to be resolved.
Apart from this, we are not currently aware of any unresolved strategic cross-boundary
matters that would prevent the preferred strategy from being delivered. However, should it be
proven that we cannot deliver our strategy because of any reason later in the plan process,
then we will need to talk with our neighbours. We will continue to engage with all relevant
organisations as we take the plan forward.
Transport Strategy
Figure 11: Map of existing and proposed major transport projects
There are a number of committed infrastructure proposals being progressed by transport
bodies, including for example the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority,
Greater Cambridge Partnership, National Highways and East West Rail Company, that will
provide significant transport capacity to support the delivery of committed development. We
                                                                                       43

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
are working together with these bodies to support delivery of these schemes, and with the
Combined Authority as Local Transport Authority and Cambridgeshire County Council as
Highways Authority in particular to progress our own Local Plan evidence.
Our proposed strategy is heavily informed by the location of existing and committed public
transport schemes. For example, locating growth at Cambourne takes advantage of the
proposed East West Rail station and Cambourne to Cambridge Public Transport Scheme;
equally, North East Cambridge is made more sustainable by the presence of Cambridge
North Station, the proposed Waterbeach to Cambridge North Public Transport Scheme, and
Waterbeach Greenway. Beyond this, we have undertaken transport modelling to understand
whether additional infrastructure and policies, beyond these proposals, would be required to
address the transport impacts of the preferred development strategy. Transport infrastructure
and policy requirements associated with specific proposed allocations are set out in each
allocation policy within this chapter.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Initial responses to the First Conversation question that asked respondents to rank the six
spatial choices identified in the consultation, indicated that densification of existing urban
areas was the most popular location for siting new development. Public Transport Corridors
was the second most popular spatial choice; Edge of Cambridge – Green Belt was the least
popular location, but a majority responded positively to Question 39 which asked ‘Should we
look to remove land from the Green Belt if evidence shows it provides a more sustainable
development option by reducing travel distances, helping us reduce our climate impacts?’.
A variety of comments were shared in relation to each spatial choice, with many noting
the need to limit carbon emissions associated with transport by locating new development
close to existing jobs and services or else close to existing and proposed public transport
infrastructure. Comments relating to densification and the edge of Cambridge highlighted
the tension between locating growth here to provide good access to existing facilities, with
the townscape and landscape impacts this would have. Comments relating to villages were
mixed, with some highlighting the benefits of development in supporting services, while
others identified negative carbon and historic environment impacts.
What alternatives did we consider?
The Councils have explored a wide range of alternative options in developing the First
Proposals strategy. This began with identifying and testing 6 spatial options in our First
Conversation consultation (issues and options) including undertaking sustainability appraisal.
As we developed our interim evidence, we initially identified 3 growth level options for homes
and jobs and 2 further blended spatial strategies creating 8 spatial options. These were all

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
tested so we considered 24 strategy options in our interim evidence published in November
2020, including a further Sustainability Appraisal.
As we moved towards identifying our preferred strategy, we identified our objectively
assessed need for jobs and homes (see S/JH Jobs and Homes). Drawing on the evidence
we started by identifying a high level preferred spatial option, which included the core
preferred strategic sites of North East Cambridge, Cambridge East and Cambourne to
provide the majority of our objectively assessed needs. Our evidence showed that these
performed well against our core evidence and better than most other alternative options
when considered against key aims of:
■   Reducing climate impacts through compact development located to connect homes and
    jobs, and where active and sustainable travel can be maximised;
■   Making best use of suitable safeguarded and brownfield land;
■   Making best use of existing and committed key sustainable transport infrastructure; and
■   Supporting rural communities to thrive and sustain services.
As we developed a working preferred option for further testing, we identified a further
blended spatial option that warranted testing, which was similar to the preferred option
with the exception that it did not include Cambourne and did include non site specific
locations on the edge of Cambridge in the Green Belt. Both were tested in a comparable
way to the 8 spatial options, so ten spatial options were tested, prior to confirming the
final preferred strategy.
Whilst edge of Cambridge Green Belt sites performed in a similar way in many respects to
Cambridge East, they would have significant Green Belt impacts and given the relatively
good performance of Cambourne, which is not in the Green Belt and would benefit from East
West Rail, there was considered to be no exceptional circumstances for releasing land on
the edge of Cambridge to meet development needs as a matter of principle and that spatial
option was not preferred. Consideration was given to whether there were any site specific
exceptional circumstances for releasing any particular site from the Green Belt and only the
Cambridge Biomedical Campus was identified as potentially being able to demonstrate such
exceptional circumstances. All other sites on the edge of Cambridge in the Green Belt were
not able to do so and were not preferred.
Consideration was given to the provision of a range of sizes and types of sites to give
flexibility and help with delivery over the plan period, reflecting our evidence, and a
modest element of housing was in principle considered to be an appropriate element of
the strategy. Drawing on our evidence, a wide range of sites were considered but many
were not preferred due to their impacts, with only a limited number of sites being preferred
in Cambridge, close to centres of employment in the southern cluster, and in villages well
served by public transport in the rest of the rural area. Allocating large numbers of sites in
                                                                                       45

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
villages was not a preferred approach, as evidence demonstrated how poorly a dispersed
strategy performed with regard to a number of issues, but particularly in relation to transport
and carbon impacts.
In summary, drawing on our evidence and consultation feedback, alternatives to our
preferred option would either distribute development to less sustainable locations that are
distant from Cambridge or without the benefit of very high quality public transport (existing
or proposed) that would generate greater car use contrary to our climate change theme,
or would require the release of large areas of Green Belt on the edge of Cambridge which
would cause significant harm to the purposes of the Cambridge Green Belt. Full information
regarding the testing of these alternatives can be found in the Sustainability Appraisal
accompanying the First Proposals.

Policy S/SH: Settlement hierarchy
What will this policy do?
This policy will group together similar settlements into categories that reflect their scale,
characteristics and sustainability. It will then set out the scale of development proposals
coming through planning applications for unallocated sites that would be potentially suitable
in each category of settlement.
Proposed policy direction
We propose that Cambridge will remain at the top of the settlement hierarchy as the main
urban centre in Greater Cambridge. Outside Cambridge, the South Cambridgeshire Local
Plan 2018 identifies its two new towns next and then groups the villages into four categories of
Rural Centres, Minor Rural Centres, Group Villages, and Infill Villages. It is proposed to retain
this approach, and the current position of each village, subject to a number of changes:
■  The Towns category should include Northstowe and Waterbeach new town, and should
   also include Cambourne
■  Cottenham will be moved from a Rural Centre to a Minor Rural Centre
■  Babraham is to be upgraded from an Infill Village to a Group Village.
Windfall proposals for residential development coming through planning applications within
these settlements (see S/SB on settlement boundaries) will be subject to the following:
■  Cambridge: No limit on individual scheme size.
■  Town: No limit on individual scheme size.
■  Rural Centre: No limit on individual scheme size.
■  Minor Rural Centre: indicative maximum scheme size of 30 dwellings
■  Group Village: indicative maximum scheme size of 8 dwellings, and exceptionally consist
   of up to about 15 dwellings where this would make the best use of a single brownfield
   site.
■  Infill Village: indicative maximum scheme size of 2 dwellings, and exceptionally consist
   of up to about 8 dwellings where this would lead to the sustainable reuse of a brownfield
   site bringing positive overall benefit to the village.
Why is this policy needed?
The settlement hierarchy remains an important element of the sustainable development
strategy, helping to direct housing to the most sustainable locations and control the level of
windfall development that takes place in the least sustainable areas of Greater Cambridge,
whilst enabling the recycling of land and delivering new homes to meet local housing needs.
An updated assessment of settlements has been carried out, informed by the level of
                                                                                        47

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
services and facilities, education, public transport and employment available at each
settlement. This showed that the positioning of settlements within the hierarchy remains
appropriate, with the exception of three proposed changes:
■  Cambourne is a growing centre, with a growing level of services, facilities and transport
   opportunities. This has been recognised by it now having a town council, and it is
   considered that this should be recognised in the local plan.
■  Cottenham should be classified as a Minor Rural Centre reflecting a revision to the
   criteria for Rural Centres that they must all have high quality public transport in the
   form of a segregated public transport route such as the Greater Cambridge Partnership
   schemes or the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, which is not the case for Cottenham.
■  Babraham should be classified as a Group village as it has a primary school, for
   consistency with other group villages.
This is a delicate balance between supporting housing development and the reuse of
brownfield land, whilst avoiding unsustainable scales of development in areas where there
is more limited access to services, facilities, and employment. Whilst there is a desire to
provide flexibility to help meet housing needs, that has to be balanced with the evidence
coming through our Net Zero Carbon Study (2021) that growth in smaller villages tends
to generate higher levels of carbon than urban development. On balance, we think the
indicative scheme sizes in the current policies remain appropriate, and they are proposed to
be carried forward into the new local plan.

Figure 13: Map showing existing settlement hierarchy in adopted Local Plans
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In the First Conversation we asked about whether the plan should be more flexible
regarding development within village boundaries. Views were mixed, although the majority
of comments supported greater flexibility. Concerns included that it did not allow best use of
sites if they became available, or would restrict delivery of housing. Those against greater
flexibility were concerned about the impact of growth on villages, and the impact on village
services.
                                                                                       49

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
Having no limits on the scale of individual developments for all settlements – Not considered
a reasonable alternative as it could lead to unsustainable levels of development in poorly
served areas.

Policy S/SB: Settlement boundaries
What will this policy do?
This policy will define the boundaries of settlements for planning purposes.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will include settlement boundaries around settlements, identifying areas that
are considered to be part of the settlement for planning purposes. The boundaries will be
drawn on the Policies Map that will accompany the draft Local Plan for consultation.
We propose that boundaries are defined to take into account the present extent of the
built-up area as well as planned new development. Buildings associated with countryside
uses, such as farm buildings, would not normally be included within a settlement boundary.
Boundaries would not be defined around small clusters of houses or areas of scattered
development where such buildings are isolated in open countryside or detached from the
main concentration of buildings within Cambridge or a nearby village.
Where planned developments, such as new settlements, have reached sufficient certainty
regarding their exact boundaries, new settlement boundaries will be drawn. Within settlement
boundaries a range of policies within the Local Plan will indicate what sorts of developments
may be suitable. This includes residential development, as indicated in the settlement
hierarchy policy approach (at S/SH).
Outside settlement boundaries, we propose that no development would be permitted
except for:
■  allocations within Neighbourhood Plans that have come into force;
■  Rural Exception sites (see policy approach H/ES) which help meet local needs for
   affordable housing;
■  development for agriculture, horticulture, forestry, outdoor recreation and other uses that
   need to be located in the countryside; or
■  development supported by other policies in the plan.
Why is this policy needed?
Settlement boundaries define where policies for the built-up areas of settlements give way
to policies for the countryside. This is necessary to ensure that the countryside is protected
from gradual encroachment, but in particular they help guard against incremental growth in
unsustainable locations. An important element of the development strategy is to focus growth
in the more sustainable locations of the area, and settlement boundaries help achieve this
purpose.
                                                                                       51
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
In the countryside development is generally restricted to uses that need to be located there.
The plan includes some flexibility for reusing existing buildings, for development which
supports the rural economy, and for other uses which need a countryside location.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The First Conversation did not ask a specific question on settlement boundaries, but it did
ask how flexible the Local Plan should be towards development of both jobs and homes on
the edge of villages. Responses were mixed. Many representors seeking site allocations
cited the need for flexibility in order to provide flexibility to deliver the homes that are needed.
Others, including some parish councils, said that frameworks should be explored more
rigorously. It was also stated that settlement boundaries help in achieving rural exception
sites for affordable housing.
What alternatives did we consider?
Not including settlement boundaries and adopting a more flexible approach to settlement
edges – Not considered a reasonable alternative as it would not provide certainty regarding
development proposals, could impact on settlement character, and result in gradual
expansion of settlements into the countryside.

2.2       Cambridge urban area
Cambridge urban area includes all of the built-up area of Cambridge, irrespective of the
administrative boundary between Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire
District Council.
Our ambition is for the historic core of Cambridge to be protected and enhanced by
appropriate new development of the highest design quality, and for the centre to be
complemented by active, compact neighbourhoods – new and old. This means regenerating
parts of the city that aren’t fulfilling their potential, and creating new neighbourhoods on the
larger brownfield sites, such as at North East Cambridge. These must have the critical mass
of homes, jobs and services to create thriving communities, fully integrated with surrounding
areas and making the best use of brownfield land. We want all of Cambridge to be a place
where walking, cycling and public transport is the natural choice and where unnecessary
private car use is discouraged to help with our net zero carbon ambition.

Locating development within the Cambridge urban area is a highly sustainable development
option, because of its very good accessibility by walking, cycling and public transport to
existing facilities and services. This brings particular benefits for climate change mitigation,
equalities, health, air quality, economy and employment, and helps to limit development
on greenfield land. Development must also be carefully designed to respect the historic
character of the city.

Figure 15: Map of proposed North East Cambridge policy area
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the placemaking vision for, and the scale and scope of development
at North East Cambridge and provide a robust planning framework for the comprehensive
redevelopment of this site.
Proposed policy direction
North East Cambridge will form an important part of the development strategy for the Local
Plan. This site is one of the last few remaining significant brownfield sites within the city,
where comprehensive redevelopment will support new homes and jobs as part of a new city
district.
We want North East Cambridge to be an inclusive, walkable, low-carbon new city district
with a lively mix of homes, workplaces, services and social spaces, fully integrated with
surrounding neighbourhoods. Separately to the joint Local Plan, the councils are also
preparing an Area Action Plan for North East Cambridge which will provide a detailed
                                                                                       55
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
planning framework containing site specific policies which will be of equal status to those
in the Local Plan once adopted. A key component of the Area Action Plan is the Spatial
Framework which will set out how this new city district should be planned.
Once developed in full, which will extend beyond the Local Plan period of 2041, North East
Cambridge is anticipated to deliver 8,350 new homes, 15,000 additional jobs as well as a
wide range of necessary infrastructure to support the development including new schools,
community and cultural facilities, open spaces as well as enhanced and new walking and
cycling connections into and through the Area Action Plan area. This amount of development
is predicated on the relocation of the existing Waste Water Treatment Works, a process
being led by Anglian Water. It is also reliant on the successful implementation of the North
East Cambridge Trip Budget, which has been calculated to ensure that there are no
additional vehicle trips on Milton Road at peak times (from 2017 levels) and subsequently
not result in queuing on the A14 at Milton Interchange (Junction 33).
To achieve the vision of a compact, walkable and mixed-use city district, the policy approach
for North East Cambridge is for a higher density development. This will create a critical mass
of new residents and workers to support these new services. It will also seek to place more
homes closer to existing and future employment areas as well as public transport. The North
East Cambridge site is well served by public transport and active travel options, including
Cambridge North Station and the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway. It is expected that this will
improve further with a number of planned projects such as the Chisholm Trail, Waterbeach to
Cambridge Public Transport Corridor and Waterbeach Greenway.
The key requirements for the site to come forward for development will be set out in the
North East Cambridge Area Action Plan.
The following allocations fall within the North East Cambridge area, and are therefore not
proposed to be carried forward as they will be superseded by this policy and the emerging
Area Action Plan:

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
North East Cambridge is identified in the adopted Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire
Local Plans (2018). The Plans identified that an Area Action Plan should be prepared
by both councils to establish the boundary of the Area Action Plan and amount of
development within it.
In March 2019, the government announced that the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough
Combined Authority, working with Cambridge City Council, Anglian Water and other key
partners, had been successful in securing £227 million from the Housing Infrastructure Fund
(HIF) to relocate the Waste Water Treatment Plant offsite. This is a separate process that will
enable the North East Cambridge area to be unlocked for comprehensive development.
Based on the preparation of the North East Cambridge Area Action Plan undertaken by
the councils to date, it is considered that the Area Action Plan area could accommodate in
total up to 8,350 dwellings (with around 4,000 during the Local Plan Period), around 15,000
new jobs (with only some of those anticipated during the Local Plan Period) and adequate
infrastructure to support the development. The amount of development has been amended
since the consultation on the draft Area Action Plan to take into account the comments
received as well as the latest evidence. This includes the enhanced provision of onsite
informal and children’s play space as well as envisaging some offsite provision at Chesterton
Fen for informal amenity space. Formal sports facilities will be largely delivered off-site as
part of a comprehensive approach to new provision when the need for future sport facilities
is considered in combination with other planned growth and proposed sites. The revised
Area Action Plan will be considered by the councils in autumn 2021 and look at these issues
in more detail.
North East Cambridge forms an important part of the development strategy for the Local
Plan. Therefore, whilst there is a separate Area Action Plan process underway by the
Councils, the amount of growth planned for also needs to be reflected in the Local Plan. The
member process to confirm the next stage of the North East Cambridge Area Action Plan will
take place in late 2021.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation but
sites such as North East Cambridge did provide some context to some of the proposed
Spatial Options for future growth across Greater Cambridge.
Separately, there have been two rounds of Issues and Options consultation (2014 and 2019)
on the North East Cambridge Area Action Plan as well as consultation on a draft North East
Cambridge Area Action Plan in 2020.
                                                                                       57

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No Policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach as it would not make best use
of the opportunities provided by this brownfield site in Cambridge or provide a policy for the
future evolution of the site, and the emerging North East Cambridge Area Action Plan.
2. Reduced developable area by retaining a consolidated Waste Water Treatment Works
on site as either an indoors or outdoors facility - Not considered a reasonable alternative as
evidence shows that this is not deliverable or viable and is therefore not considered to be a
reasonable alternative.
3. Higher quantum of development – This alternative is not the preferred approach due to
placemaking implications, including open space provision, building heights and development
mix as well as delivery of the Trip Budget.
4. Lower quantum of development - Rejected as evidence shows that this is not deliverable
or viable and is therefore not considered to be a reasonable alternative.

Figure 16: Map showing proposed Areas of Major Change in Cambridge urban area
What will this policy do?
This policy will provide continued policy guidance for existing Areas of Major Change in the
urban area of Cambridge identified in the Cambridge Local Plan 2018, as still appropriate
and where not covered elsewhere in the First Proposals.
Proposed policy direction
Areas of Major Change are extensive areas of development comprising defined and known
sites collectively shaping the spatial structure of Cambridge. They require a comprehensive
approach to development and renewal that recognises the dependencies between sites in
order to bring forward holistic change. They also need careful integration with existing nearby
communities. They embrace mixed uses and multiple functions, and require significant
infrastructure investment and support. The need for the policy and any revisions to any of the
identified areas will be considered for the draft plan.
                                                                                      59

Continuing existing Areas of Major Change
It is proposed to continue to identify the following Areas of Major Change:
■   S/AMC/Policy 21: Station Areas West and Clifton Road
■   S/AMC/Policy 12: Fitzroy/Burleigh Street/Grafton
■   S/AMC/Policy 16: South of Coldham’s Lane
It is also proposed to continue the following Areas of Major Change located on the edge of
Cambridge.
■   Policy 17: Cambridge Biomedical Campus (including Addenbrooke’s Hospital) Area of
    Major Change: An expanded Area of Major Change (see S/CBC for more details)
■   S/AMC/Policy 19: West Cambridge Area of Major Change – we will consider expansion
    of the Area to include Eddington as we prepare the draft plan.
■   Policy 20: Land between Huntingdon Road and Histon Road Area of Major Change – we
    will consider expansion of this Area to include sites within South Cambridgeshire (see
    also S/EOC for more details)
Maps showing the boundaries of these Areas of Major Change can be found at the end of
this document.
It is not proposed to carry forward the Area of Major Change identified in the adopted 2018
Cambridge Local Plan Policy 18: Southern Fringe Areas of Major Change.
Why is this policy needed?
In these Areas of Major Change policy guidance is required so that development
opportunities in these locations are progressed in a comprehensive manner, including
ensuring careful integration with existing nearby communities.
It is considered that the new Local Plan should continue to provide planning guidance in the
areas proposed to be carried forward from the 2018 Cambridge Local Plan.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as it is considered that this would not
provide sufficient guidance for planning in important areas of the city.

Policy S/OA: Opportunity Areas in Cambridge
Figure 17: Map of proposed opportunity areas in Cambridge urban area
What will this policy do?
Identify specific locations as Opportunity Areas that would benefit from a holistic approach to
any future development that comes forward, to provide policy guidance for development that
also improves public transport access and infrastructure delivery, and seeks improvements
to the public realm.
Proposed policy direction
Opportunity Areas provide opportunities to enable development that can reinforce and create
character and identity in key corridors and centres of the city, often through associated public
realm improvements. Opportunity Areas embrace mixed uses and multiple functions, which
provides opportunities and challenges, and requires a policy framework to promote and
guide overall change during the life of the plan.
Given the opportunity nature of these sites they do not include any particular levels of
development and are not counted towards meeting our needs.

New Opportunity Areas
S/OA/NR        Newmarket Road Retail Park
S/OA/BC        Beehive Centre
Two new Opportunity Areas are proposed that are areas of low density, large-scale retail
uses with extensive surface car parking. This does not make very good use of an expansive
area of land in the heart of Cambridge. With changes in retailing and the increase in online
shopping, when taken together with the Local Plan themes of addressing climate change
and creating Great Places, these sites have the potential to provide a significant opportunity
for reimagining this area close to the heart of Cambridge. There are land contamination
issues at the Newmarket Road Retail Park that will need to be explored carefully as part of
any site intensification proposals. These opportunities can be explored further as the plan
progresses, including having regard to emerging evidence about future retail needs to inform
the next draft plan stage.

 S/OA/AS Abbey Stadium
 The Abbey Stadium is home to Cambridge United Football Club. The club is keen to improve
 its facilities to raise its profile as a commercial sporting enterprise. It could achieve this aim
 by either staying on site and securing enabling development on site alongside an enhanced
 stadium facility or by relocating elsewhere and redeveloping the existing site for new homes.
 The draft plan will provide guidance for this site for both possibilities.

■   S/OA/Policy 22: Mitcham’s Corner
■   S/OA/Policy 23: Eastern Gate
■   S/OA/Policy 24: Mill Road
■   S/OA/Policy 25: Cambridge Railway Station, Hills Road Corridor to the City Centre
■   S/OA/Policy 26: Old Press/Mill Lane

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
In these Opportunity Areas policy guidance is provided so that the opportunities and
challenges are identified and responded to, to make the best use of these parts of
Cambridge, which respond to the character of the area and provide uses and spaces that
meet the needs of people.
It is considered that the new Local Plan should continue to provide planning guidance in
the areas proposed to be carried forward from the 2018 Cambridge Local Plan, and identify
any new areas which would benefit from this approach. The Housing and Employment Land
Availability Assessment identified some areas where change could happen in the future as a
result of changing retail needs or redevelopment opportunities becoming available. This has
informed the identification of new areas.
In proposing to carry forward the existing opportunity areas identified some comments have
been made on the extent of these areas, and the site boundaries will be considered as we
prepare the draft plan.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as it is considered that this would not
provide sufficient guidance for planning in important areas of the city.

Policy S/LAC: Other site allocations in Cambridge
Figure 22: Map of other site allocations in Cambridge urban area
What will this policy do?
Identify specific site allocations for development in the Cambridge urban area, mainly rolling
forward sites from the 2018 Cambridge Local Plan with one new housing site and one
refined employment site.
Proposed policy direction
New allocations
The following new allocations are proposed in the Cambridge urban area:
Housing
S/C/SMS Garages between 20 St. Matthews Street and Blue Moon Public House,
Cambridge
■   Site area of 0.1 hectares
■   Capacity for approximately 12 homes, with potential to review the number at later stages
    of plan making
■   Opportunity to improve the character of an existing garages site in a highly sustainable
    location close to the centre of Cambridge with easy walking access to shops,
    employment and public transport.

S/C/SCL Land South of Coldham’s Lane, Cambridge
■  Site area of 9 hectares
■  Suitable for commercial development (such as relocation of ‘space intensive’ uses such
   as builders’ merchants sales and storage facilities which are currently located on land
   elsewhere in the city)
■  This site is part of the wider existing South of Coldham’s Lane Area of Major Change.
   This allocation recognises that part of the site is capable of development which takes
   account of the constraints and opportunities of the site. It is proposed to carry this policy
   forward into the new LocalPlan.
■  The former landfill sites at Coldham’s Lane include areas of potential ecological
   importance. Any redevelopment of the eastern portion of the landfill sites will require
   ecological enhancement as part of any redevelopment on site and provision of
                                                                                       69

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Allocations not proposed to be carried forward
Housing
The following residential allocations within the Cambridge Local Plan 2018 have been or are
being built out and are sufficiently advanced that they do not need a policy framework any
longer, and are therefore not proposed to be carried forward:
■   R1: 295 Histon Road
■   R3: City Football Ground, Milton Road
■   R10: Mill Road Depot and adjoining properties, Mill Road
■   R12: Ridgeons, 75 Cromwell Road
■   R17: Mount Pleasant House, Mount Pleasant
The following residential allocations are not proposed to be carried forward for the reasons
set out below:
■   R7: The Paddocks, 347 Cherry Hinton Road – this is an active site of mixed commercial
    uses and in reviewing whether the allocation should be carried forward, it is considered
    more appropriate to retain the site for the existing uses, rather than it being redeveloped for
    residential uses. We also have no evidence that it will still come forward for residential uses.
■   R8: 149 Cherry Hinton Road & Telephone Exchange, Coleridge Road – there is
    uncertainty whether this site will still come forward for residential uses by 2041.
■   R11: Horizon Resource Centre, 285 Coldham’s Lane – there is uncertainty whether this
    site will still come forward for residential uses by 2041.
■   R14: BT telephone Exchange and car park, Long Road – there is uncertainty whether
    this site will still come forward site for residential uses by 2041.
■   R16: Cambridge Professional Development Centre, Foster Road – there is uncertainty
    whether this site will still come forward for residential uses by 2041.
Mixed Use
The following mixed use allocations within the Cambridge Local Plan 2018 have been built
out, and are therefore not proposed to be carried forward:
■   M3: Michael Young Centre, Purbeck Road
Employment
The following employment allocations are not proposed to be carried forward for the reasons
set out below:
■   E4: Church End Industrial Estate, Rosemary Lane – this is an existing employment site
    that is important to protect for employment uses, therefore we consider it should be
    de-allocated but be included as a protected industrial site, as set out in J/PB: Protecting
    existing business space.
■   E5: 1 and 7-11 Hills Road – the redevelopment of this site is not considered to be

   deliverable and therefore the Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic
   Development Evidence Study (November 2020) recommends that it is de-allocated.
Why is this policy needed?
Cambridge is a highly sustainable location for additional homes and jobs, relating to its
accessibility to existing jobs and services.
Previous local plans have allocated most opportunities for development within the urban area
of Cambridge. As a result, there are relatively few smaller scale development opportunities
in Cambridge that have not previously been considered. Noting the benefits of this location,
we have explored whether there are any further specific development opportunities in the
Cambridge urban area that are available, suitable and achievable within the plan period, and
can contribute to meeting the development needs identified. These have been informed by
the Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment (2021). Following this process,
two new sites have been identified in the Cambridge urban area that are proposed for
allocation – one for new homes and one for new employment uses. It had been anticipated
that there would be further opportunities identified given it is the most sustainable location in
Greater Cambridge but it has not been possible to do so.
However, this is in part due to the very thorough and detailed assessments that had informed
the Cambridge Local Plan 2018 to identify suitable and available land opportunities in
the city. Some of these have now been built, or are well progressed, and will no longer
need to be included in the new plan. Many others are indicated to come forward over the
coming years, and warrant retention in the plan. Nevertheless, as part of our on-going
work monitoring the delivery of sites, there are some existing allocations which are no
longer anticipated to come forward for the use allocated. They are therefore proposed to be
removed from the plan unless additional evidence to continue to include them comes forward
during the plan making process.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation. The
annual housing trajectory process involves consultation with landowners and developers and
the latest housing trajectory has informed the plan making process.
What alternatives did we consider?
We considered a range of alternative sites within the Cambridge urban area having
regard to the overarching development strategy and the conclusions of the Housing and
Employment Land Availability Assessment. We discounted sites considered to be less
suitable for development or where there is not clear evidence that they will come forward in
the plan period.
                                                                                      73

2.3       The edge of Cambridge
Sites located on the edge of Cambridge will extend the built-up area beyond its previous
footprint.
We want to complete the planned new neighbourhoods on the edge of Cambridge from
previous plans as well as bringing forward new opportunities for sustainable developments,
which successfully link the city to the countryside, and where active and public transport is
the natural first choice. These should be lively, mixed-use areas to live and work, with local
centres of community activity, and their design should enhance the setting of Cambridge in
the landscape. We think that development around the edge of Cambridge should come with
improved green and natural spaces which are accessible for everyone to enjoy, as part of an
expanded network of green infrastructure across the area.
How
        have
                the
                      themes
                                   influenced
                                                     this?
Locating development on the edge of Cambridge is a sustainable development option,
because of its good accessibility by walking, cycling and public transport to existing facilities
and services. Our edge of Cambridge sites are mostly large scale, and will therefore support
provision of new shops, services and facilities. This brings particular benefits for climate
change and reducing carbon, sharing the benefits of growth with nearby areas, creating
healthy new communities, and supporting the economy.
                                                                                       75

What will this policy do?
Set the placemaking vision and the amount of development for a major new eastern quarter
on land at Cambridge East – both the safeguarded land in the 2018 Local Plans and the
adopted allocations for North of Newmarket Road and North of Cherry Hinton.
Proposed policy direction
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will allocate land for a major new eastern quarter for
Cambridge, enabling development of the airport site which was safeguarded for longer term
development in the 2018 adopted Local Plans:
■   For approximately 7,000 homes, including affordable homes, and 9,000 jobs on
    the ‘safeguarded land’ identified in the 2018 Local Plans at Cambridge Airport. It is
    anticipated that around 2,900 homes will be delivered by 2041.
■   Carry forward sites North of Newmarket Road (being built as Marleigh) and Land north of
    Cherry Hinton (with planning permission) and ensure a comprehensive approach to the
                                                                                     77
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
   eastern quarter as originally envisaged in the Cambridge East Area Action Plan.
■  Delivery of the full development will require the Greater Cambridge Partnership
   Cambridge Eastern Access scheme Phase B to be in place which will provide high
   quality public transport connections, with the amount of development that can come
   forward ahead of the scheme to be determined.
■  Development is also reliant on the successful implementation of a Trip Budget
   approach, to ensure that the level of vehicle trips is limited to an appropriate level for the
   surrounding road network.
■  The potential need for, or desirability of, other connections by new public transport, cycling
   and walking links to centres of employment and other sustainable transport connections,
   such as Cambridge North Station and North East Cambridge, Cambridge South Station
   and Cambridge Biomedical Campus, and Cambridge Station and the City Centre will be
   explored through the preparation of the draft local plan, including their deliverability.
■  A mix of employment uses, including offices, workshops and other uses, providing a
   variety of opportunities to support not only Cambridge’s high technology clusters, but
   also industry and creative uses, including local jobs to provide for existing communities
   and help contribute to community integration.
■  A new centre for retail, cultural and other uses that will serve the urban quarter and wider
   area whilst complementing and not competing with the historic City centre.
■  All necessary supporting community infrastructure including primary and secondary
   schools
■  To retain a green corridor through the development to link the countryside with
   Coldham’s Common and the heart of Cambridge, that lies within the Green Belt and has
   a landscaping, biodiversity and recreation function whilst also maintaining the individual
   identity of Teversham village.
■  Open space within the site, and green infrastructure within and adjoining the area,
   including providing additional wildlife habitat land surrounding the designated nature sites
   to the east of Cambridge, as part of the Eastern Fens green infrastructure initiative.
The proposal will integrate with the existing developments north of Newmarket Road and
North of Cherry Hinton to ensure a comprehensive approach to this new eastern quarter as
originally envisaged but updated to respond to the themes of the new plan. The proposal is
also subject to continued evidence from Marshall to demonstrate that the existing Airport use
will cease and the airside uses can be successfully relocated and in a timely way, currently
anticipated to be in 2030.
The new plan will review and incorporate as appropriate the existing allocations for new
mixed use developments adjoining the safeguarded land:
■  S/CE/R45: Land north of Newmarket Road (within Cambridge)
■  S/CE/R47: Land north of Cherry Hinton within Cambridge)

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
■   S/CE/SS/3(1a): Cambridge East (Land north of Newmarket Road within South
    Cambridgeshire)
■   S/CE/SS/3(1b): Land north of Cherry Hinton within South Cambridgeshire
The following existing allocation which formed part of the wider Cambridge East area has
been built out, and is therefore not proposed to be carried forward:
■   R41: Land north of Coldham’s Lane
Why is this policy needed?
Land at Cambridge East has long been recognised as having significant potential to be
a sustainable major new eastern quarter for Cambridge, that is well connected to the
rest of the City, with a mix of homes and a range of jobs and services and supporting
infrastructure. Whilst the Airport and land north of Newmarket Road around the car
showrooms had originally been identified for development in 2003, the adopted 2018
Local Plans changed the allocation to an approach that safeguarded the land for future
development if Marshall were to advise that the Airport land would be made available for
development. The adopted plans allocate land north of Newmarket Road and Land north
of Cherry Hinton for housing led development as early phases of the full development
that could come forward while the Airport is still operational. The adopted plans say that
development on the safeguarded land will only occur once the site becomes available and
following a review of both the adopted plans and the Cambridge East Area Action Plan.
The new plan will include the outcome of that review.
Marshall has advised the Councils of its commitment to relocate the Airport related uses
and seeks to demonstrate the availability and deliverability of the site. It advises that it
has a signed option agreement at Cranfield Airport, Bedford and that there would be no
commercial, planning, technical or regulatory impediment to a move to Cranfield and vacant
possession is anticipated by 2030. This gives a reasonable level of confidence at this
early stage in the plan process that the site is likely to come forward in time to help meet
development needs in the plan period as well as beyond. It is important that there should
be sufficient evidence to demonstrate clearly that the plan can be delivered by the time it
reaches the later formal stages and so the position will be kept under review during the plan
making process.
The proposal to include the Airport as part of the strategy for the new plan would make
good use of safeguarded land in the 2018 Local Plans that is also a brownfield site and is
a good fit with a low carbon growth. The additional homes and jobs envisaged for the site
are proposed to be located on the ‘safeguarded land’ identified in the 2018 Local Plans,
currently in use by Cambridge Airport; delivery of these homes and jobs would start post
2030 to follow relocation of Marshall’s airside activities. Marshall proposed a larger site that
                                                                                       79
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
would require land to be released from the Green Belt. The Councils consider there are no
exceptional circumstances for releasing the land from the Green Belt, and that homes and
jobs would not come forward in the plan period on the basis that that only part of the site is
capable of coming forward by 2041 and that development should build out from the current
edge of Cambridge.
The new eastern quarter has the capability of being well connected to the rest of the City,
both in terms of its location and also the provision of a new high quality public transport
connection (Phase B of the Greater Cambridge Partnership Cambridge Eastern Access
scheme). To ensure a low carbon development the proposals will need to ensure trips in
and out of the area are minimised by providing a balance between new homes and a range
of jobs. The development will also be expected to integrate positively with surrounding
neighbourhoods to ensure the development is accessible to and also brings benefits to those
communities, including through provision of local jobs that help meet needs of adjoining
communities and help support community cohesion. There will be a range of densities
across this large site, with variations that focus higher densities at the new centre and close
to the new public transport scheme.
The adopted 2018 Local Plans retained in the Green Belt a green corridor through the
development site to ensure the green corridor linking the countryside with Coldham’s
Common and on into the heart of Cambridge is maintained. At the end of the adopted
green corridor around Teversham it widens out to provide green separation between the
new eastern quarter and the village. It is intended that this would be carried forward into
the new plan.
Development here would provide an additional impetus to provide additional wildlife habitat
land surrounding the designated nature sites to the east of Cambridge, as part of the Eastern
Fens green infrastructure initiative which has been identified in the Green Infrastructure and
Biodiversity theme.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In the First Conversation consultation we asked what you thought about developing around
the edge of Cambridge on land outside the Green Belt, and highlighted that the only large
site on the edge of Cambridge not in the Green Belt is Cambridge Airport. There was support
for development of the site as it was not in the Green Belt. Some questioned its availability,
although Marshalls themselves commented in support of allocating the site.

What alternatives did we consider?
1. To not allocate the site and instead carry forward the safeguarded land and more limited
allocations in the adopted plans, but this was not preferred given the suitability of the
safeguarded land, Marshall’s have confirmed that the site will be available during the plan
period, and the evidence suggests that could fit with the themes and vision for the plan.
2. A larger land release reflecting the proposal by Marshall – This alternative is not the
preferred approach, due to the level of harm to Green Belt and landscape that is not
justified by exceptional circumstances or a need to meet housing or employment provision
in the plan period.

What will this policy do?
This policy will guide the continued development of the University’s North West Cambridge
development, known as Eddington, including additional policy provision to accommodate the
additional homes identified in the development strategy.
Proposed policy direction
The updated policy will enable the development of additional dwellings on the site beyond
those identified in current plans, provided through changes to the dwelling mix and
appropriate intensification of development areas that have yet to be built. This will be
identified in the draft Local Plan following a detailed review of the site wide masterplan, but is
anticipated to be in the region of 1,000 to 1,500 homes.
The North West Cambridge Area Action Plan requires a minimum of 50% affordable housing
to meet the needs of Cambridge University and College key workers in housing need,
subject to viability considerations, whether there are other planning objectives that need to

be given priority, and the need to ensure balanced and sustainable communities. Up to date
evidence of the need for affordable housing for key workers will be required. If need is not
demonstrated, provision should be in the form of normal affordable housing.
Additional dwellings will be built in areas already identified for development, and would not
take land identified for open space. Additional dwellings will create additional infrastructure
demands, and additional contributions to infrastructure will be required to pay for the
enhancement of facilities.
The potential for a single policy that looks at this site together with the University’s West
Cambridge site, to ensure the benefits of this significant area of innovation are maximised,
will be considered as part of preparing the draft plan.
Why is this policy needed?
The North West Cambridge Area Action Plan was adopted by Cambridge City Council and
South Cambridgeshire District Council in 2009. This released an area of land from the
Green Belt to meet the University’s long-term development needs. A planning application
was approved in 2013 for 1,500 houses and flats for key University staff, 1,500 houses and
flats for general sale to the public, accommodation for 2,000 post graduate students, and
100,000m2 of research buildings.
The development, now known as Eddington, is becoming a thriving urban quarter, and
includes a district centre with a supermarket, primary school and community facilities. At
March 2020 858 dwellings were complete (including 686 affordable dwellings), along with
325 student rooms.
The University of Cambridge has proposed that an increase of dwellings could be achieved
whilst building upon the successes of early phases, to respond to their needs whilst
continuing to deliver the scheme to a high standard. They consider that the site could
accommodate in total up to 4,500 dwellings (an increase of 1,500), alongside the other
previously approved uses. The final figure to be included in the draft Local Plan would
necessarily flow from a detailed review of the masterplan, which will include consideration of
landscape, townscape and heritage impacts. At this stage a more cautious estimate of 1,000
dwellings has been included in our assessment of housing supply.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
Carry forward guidance in the North West Cambridge Area Action Plan subject to
                                                                                       83

any updates provided by policies in the new Local Plan, and not enabling additional
development. – This was not the preferred option due to the opportunities the area presents
to meet future needs for the area by building upon an emerging new “place” in the city
located in a highly sustainable location.

What will this policy do?
This policy will guide the continued development and evolution of the Cambridge Biomedical
Campus.
Proposed policy direction
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will support development on the Cambridge Biomedical
Campus to meet local, regional or national health care needs or for biomedical and biotechnology
research and development activities, related higher education and sui generis medical research
institutes, associated support activities to meet the needs of employees and visitors, and
residential uses where it would provide affordable and key worker homes for campus employees.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
An Area of Major Change
The area for development includes the main campus (S/CBC/Policy M15 on the map), and
the area previously allocated for its extension through the South Cambridgeshire Local
Plan 2018 (S/CBC/Policy E/2 on the map). An updated masterplan will be required for
the Campus, to improve the overall experience of the site for workers and visitors. This
should maximise opportunities to improve the ‘legibility’ of the Campus by providing a
network of cycle and pedestrian routes, high quality new public realm and open space, but
in particular explore opportunities to enhance connections with the proposed Cambridge
South Railway Station.
An additional area adjoining Babraham Road (S/CBC-A on the map) is identified as a
potential area to be released from the Green Belt specifically to meet the long-term needs of
the Campus. Any release would be subject to the following:
■   Significant Green Belt enhancement in adjoining areas of White Hill and Nine Wells will
    be required to provide green infrastructure and biodiversity improvements supporting
    the objectives of the Strategic Green Infrastructure Initiative 3: Gog Magog Hills and
    chalkland fringe. These areas would remain within the Green Belt and are included in
    the Area of Major Change to highlight that future proposals for built development on the
    allocated areas must also include green infrastructure and biodiversity improvements
    within this adjoining open area.
■   A comprehensive landscaping plan, including the delivery of new publicly accessible
    green space will need to be delivered, to create a soft green edge of the city, to
    minimise the urbanising effects of the development and help compensate for harm to
    the Green Belt.
■   A comprehensive landscaping plan, including the delivery of new publicly accessible green
    space will need to be delivered, to create a soft green edge of the city, to minimise the
    urbanising effects of the development and help compensate for harm to the Green Belt.
■   Design parameters regarding the scale and height of buildings will be established, to
    respond to the landscape and townscape of Cambridge.
■   Development is dependent on the successful implementation of a Trip Budget
    approach, to ensure that the level of vehicle trips is limited to an appropriate level for the
    surrounding road network.
■   Development on the additional land will only be allowed to take place when evidence is
    provided that opportunities on the existing campus have been fully explored and utilised
    before development takes place on the released land.
■   Given the existing piecemeal development on the biomedical campus, any proposed
    release must contribute towards improving the wellbeing of campus users and
    surrounding communities, as well as addressing the spill over impacts on individuals and
    communities of this intensive employment location.

Figure 29: Map of proposed expanded Cambridge Biomedical Campus Area of Major
Change
Why is this policy needed?
The Cambridge Biomedical Campus is of national and international importance. It has a
local, regional and national role in providing medical facilities and medical research. It is a
key location for the life-sciences and biotechnology cluster of Greater Cambridge. Previous
Local Plans have responded to the 2020 vision for the campus, enabling it to evolve into its
current role. Significant investment in infrastructure is now planned, with funding committed
for a new Cambridge South Railway Station.
The Cambridge Biomedical Campus have now prepared a 2050 Vision, setting out
aspirations for its future. This includes continuing development on the existing campus site,
and an aspiration for further development. Proposals have been submitted on large areas of
land south of the campus and between the M11, Addenbrookes Road and the A1301.
National planning policy is clear that once established, Green Belt boundaries should only be
altered in exceptional circumstances, where this is fully evidenced and justified, through the
preparation or updating of plans. Given the national importance of the Campus in health, life-
sciences and biotechnology, and the significant public investment into the area with the new
  88

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Cambridge South Railway Station, it is considered that it may be possible to demonstrate a
case for exceptional circumstances to release land from the Green Belt in this location, but
this needs to be balanced with the existing supply of employment land in the area, and the
impacts on the environment and how they can be mitigated.
In considering the impact on the Green Belt it is important to consider the nature and extent
of the harm to Green Belt purposes. The Greater Cambridge Green Belt Study (2021)
identifies that release of the areas proposed would result in very high harm to the Green
Belt. In addition, there are concerns regarding biodiversity and landscape impacts of the
scale of development proposed by the Campus.
However, the Greater Cambridge Green Belt Study identifies an area adjoining Babraham
Road and north of Granham’s Road where the harm of release would be lower than other
land in this area, although this is still acknowledged as a high level of harm. There is
potential to focus development on a smaller area of land to support the Campus (S/CBC-A
on the map), that contains development on the lower land away from White Hill and provides
an opportunity to create a new comprehensive green edge to the city.
It will be crucial that impacts are minimised by effective landscaping and the enhancement
of green infrastructure south of the existing campus. National Planning policy requires
that the impact of removing land from the Green Belt to be offset through compensatory
improvements to the environmental quality and accessibility of remaining Green Belt land.
There are opportunities immediately south of the campus and west of the potential Green
Belt release, in the areas of Nine Wells and White Hill (the area bounded by the blue line of
the Proposed Area of Major Change on the map). This should include providing areas where
public access is enhanced, but it must also include improvements to areas where public
access is restricted, which can help secure biodiversity net gain, providing connections
between Nine Wells and the Gog Magog Hills. Development at the Campus is at the fringes
of the Greater Cambridge Strategic Green Infrastructure Initiative 3: Gog Magog Hills and
chalkland fringe (see BG/GI: Green Infrastructure).
The high water table and surface water flooding present challenges to development in this
area. A comprehensive approach would be required to deliver sustainable drainage systems,
which ensure the development is safe, and does not increase risk elsewhere.
If the identified land is to be released for development it is important that the best use is
made of the existing campus site first. Whilst there are some fantastic buildings and areas on
the site, there are other areas which are underused, and do not provide a good environment
for visitors and workers. It is proposed that the policy in the new Local Plan seek a
comprehensive approach to the site through a new masterplan.
The opportunities provided by the new Cambridge South Station to enhance public transport
access to the Campus need to be maximised. An updated transport strategy for the site will be
                                                                                       89

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
required. The outstanding public transport and active travel access available to the site mean that
car access and parking should be reserved for those who need it most. A ‘trip budget’ approach
needs to be applied, requiring a very high level of travel to the site by non-car modes.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No release of Green Belt or additional allocation outside the existing Campus. This
alternative is not the preferred approach, as it would not respond to the needs of the campus.
2. A larger land release reflecting the proposal (referred to as Cambridge South) by a group
of landowners with the support of the Cambridge Biomedical Campus – This alternative
is not the preferred approach, due to the level of harm to Green Belt, landscape and
biodiversity.

Figure 30: Map showing boundary of proposed West Cambridge policy area
What will this policy do?
Continue to provide a policy for future development of the West Cambridge site, refined to
better reflect the themes of the new Local Plan, including providing an element of flexibility to
include some new homes where it would support the vibrancy of the campus.
Proposed policy direction
The University through the recent resolution to grant planning permission has ambitions for
the West Cambridge Area to become an “innovation district.” The proposed allocation would
therefore carry forward the allocation of the West Cambridge site from the 2018 Local Plan,
to support the site in meeting the needs of the University, for uses related to education,
associated sui generis research, academic research, commercial research, and development
of products or processes, where it will support knowledge transfer and/or open innovation
from these for the wider Cambridgeshire and UK economy.
                                                                                     91

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
We propose to refine the policy to emphasise that future development of the site should
seek a comprehensive approach to the area, that responds to the location, and the
opportunities to create a thriving environment for people, as well as playing a significant role
supporting the high technology economy of Cambridge. It is important to provide a mix of
complementary uses to go with the work buildings if it is to operate as a successful campus.
As well as provision of high quality walking and cycling connections, development should
maximise the opportunity provided by public transport improvements such as the proposed
Greater Cambridge Partnership Cambourne to Cambridge scheme.
It is also proposed to add flexibility to the policy, to allow an element of residential, focused
on affordable housing and key workers, where it would support making the campus to
become a more vibrant employment location, and not harm employment availability.
The potential for a single policy that looks at this site together with the University’s North
West Cambridge site, to ensure the benefits of this significant area of innovation are
maximised, will be considered as part of preparing the draft plan.
Why is this policy needed?
The West Cambridge site is operated by the University of Cambridge, and is home to a
range of academic, research and other uses. The site is undergoing major change, and
developing its role as a development cluster for University science and technology research,
knowledge transfer and open innovation.
Outline planning permission was approved in July 2021 (subject to agreeing a Section 106
agreement) providing a long-term vision and strategy for the comprehensive development
of the site, and creation of the West Cambridge Innovation District. This provides
significant opportunities for academic and commercial research, along with a range of
other supporting facilities.
A policy will be needed in the new Local Plan to set out what will be expected of future
development proposals as the site evolves during the plan period.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as this would not provide a context
for the future evolution of the site, and would fail to ensure the site is available to
contribute to the University’s and the City’s future needs or provide a policy framework
for planning decisions.

The adopted 2018 Local Plans allocate developments on the north west edge of Cambridge,
referred to as Darwin Green. The part of the site in Cambridge has outline planning
permission, and some parcels have detailed planning permission or are under construction.
The land in South Cambridgeshire has yet to gain planning permission. Given the site will
still be coming forward when the new plan is adopted it is proposed to carry forward the
allocations into the new plan.
Sites allocated North and South of Worts’ Causeway for 430 new homes have outline
planning permission. The sites are likely to have been completed when the new plan is
adopted, therefore the need for the allocations to be carried forward will be kept under
review.
Land is allocated for business uses at Fulbourn Road on the eastern edge of Cambridge
in both adopted plans. This is partly under construction, and there are proposals being
considered for the remainder. The need for the allocations to be carried forward will be kept
under review.
Existing allocations at Cambridge Southern Fringe, including Clay Farm, Glebe Farm, and
Trumpington Meadows, are likely to be built out by the time the plan is adopted, therefore the
existing plan policies will no longer be required. The new homes on the existing allocation at
Bell School have been completed, however, the new student accommodation also included
within this allocation has not yet been started. The need for the allocation at Bell School will
be kept under review.

2.4        New settlements
We want our new towns to mature into great places to live and work, making the most of
their existing and planned public transport links to Cambridge and other centres. Our towns
should be real communities with their own distinctive identity, with the critical mass to support
local businesses, services and facilities. In the case of Cambourne, East-West Rail means
that it will be one of the best-connected places in the region, and we think it can develop into
a more substantial town to better help meet these aspirations.
How
        have
                 the
                       themes
                                     influenced
                                                       this?
Development near to this future transport hub will support delivering homes and jobs in
sustainable locations where there are alternatives to travelling by car. It can also help make
the existing Cambourne area more sustainable by increasing the range of services and
facilities available, and providing opportunities to create substantial new green spaces.
                                                                                          97

Policy S/CB: Cambourne
What will this policy do?
Identify Cambourne as a broad location for longer term strategic scale growth as an
expansion to Cambourne, and will provide continued guidance for the development of the
existing allocation at Cambourne West.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will set out the intention to identify Cambourne as a broad location for future
growth in the 2030’s to respond to the opportunity that will be provided by the proposed
East West Rail that includes a station at Cambourne. The overall aim for an expanded
Cambourne is to provide sufficient critical mass to perform the following role as a:
■   Well-connected place through high quality public transport, cycling and walking facilities
■   South Cambridgeshire town for the 21st century
■   growing employment centre to provide local opportunities for its residents and nearby
    communities
■   place that meets the day to day needs of its residents.
Future development at Cambourne will need to consider:
■   How to integrate with and maximise the opportunity provided by East West Rail.
■   The role of the new development in Cambourne as a place, and how it can contribute
    towards the achievement of net zero carbon.
■   The relationship with Cambourne and Bourn Airfield, and how to make the area more
    sustainable, through the mix of services, employment and transport opportunities offered
    by the area as whole.
■   The economic role of the place, and which employment sectors would benefit from the
    location to support the needs of the Greater Cambridge economy.
■   How the place will develop over time, and the infrastructure needed to support different
    stages during its development.
■   Making effective connections within the new development and with Cambourne for public
    transport and active travel, as well as connections to surrounding villages so they can
    also benefit.
■   Be structured around and have local and district centres that can meet people’s day to
    day needs within walking distance, including responding to changing retail and working
    patterns
■   How it can help deliver the Western Gateway Green Infrastructure project, and in doing
    so positively engage with its landscape setting, as well as recreation and biodiversity
    enhancement opportunities such as woodland planting.
                                                                                      99

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
■  Take opportunities to reduce flood risk to surrounding areas, that take innovative
   solutions to the management and reuse of water.
The following existing allocation for a new mixed-use development at Cambourne West
is proposed to be carried forward, but to be expanded to include the full extent of the
planning permission:
■  SS/8: Cambourne West
A map showing the boundary of this allocation can be found at the end of this document.
Why is this policy needed?
Cambourne has been identified as the location for a new railway station as part of the East
West Rail scheme to connect Oxford with Cambridge and potentially beyond. Along with the
Cambourne to Cambridge public transport scheme being brought forward by the Greater
Cambridge Partnership, it provides an opportunity to consider how further development
could make the most of these connections, but also make the overall Cambourne area a
more sustainable place. National planning policy says that plan making should look to the
opportunities provided by major new infrastructure.
It is important to recognise that our evidence says that large scale development at
Cambourne would have landscape impacts and that these would be hard to address.
However, when considered in the context of the significant economic and carbon benefits of
locating development at the proposed new rail station at Cambourne, it is considered that the
benefits are likely to outweigh the level of landscape harm. This will be explored further as
part of preparing the draft local plan, but the Councils are clear that development will need
to be a landscape led scheme to minimise impacts in the wider landscape and to have a
focus both on place making for the expanded town, and delivery of the wider vision for green
infrastructure set out in the plan, including supporting the objectives for Strategic Green
Infrastructure Initiative 8: Western gateway multifunctional Green Infrastructure corridors
(see BG/GI Green Infrastructure).
Identifying the area for additional development should not simply be about delivering more
housing. It needs to explore how this area including Cambourne and Bourn Airfield and
nearby villages will function as a place, and its relationship with Cambridge, in order to
enhance its sustainability. This means looking at a mix of services, facilities and employment
in the area, and planning new development to enhance the role of the place. It means
looking at connections between places within the area, so these opportunities are shared
and reliance on private car travel is reduced.
National planning policy allows for longer term growth in plans to be identified as broad
locations, where the exact quantity, locations and design will be defined through future

plan reviews. Given that the East West Rail route and station location at Cambourne have
yet to be confirmed, it Is too early to identify a specific development area and amount of
development.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation, but
we did ask for views about focusing development on transport corridors. There was broad
support for this approach, and focusing development at public transport nodes.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy –Alternatives to allocating development around Cambourne were considered as
part of consideration of alternative Strategic Spatial Options

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy S/NS: Existing new settlements
What will this policy do?
Confirm that the three new settlements of Northstowe, the new town north of Waterbeach,
and Bourn Airfield new village, will continue to be developed during the period of the new
Local Plan and beyond. Policies will provide a context for their development.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will carry forward the existing allocations for the following new settlements in
the 2018 South Cambridgeshire Local Plan:
■  SS/5 Northstowe
■  SS/6 Land north of Waterbeach
■  SS/7 Bourn Airfield
A map showing the boundary of this allocation can be found at the end of this document.
The detailed policy wording will be reviewed as may be appropriate in the new Local Plan,
including amending capacity assumptions where necessary to reflect planning permissions.
The Northstowe Area Action Plan will remain part of the development plan, although standards
adopted in the new Local Plan will apply to future applications. The Supplementary Planning
Documents for Land north of Waterbeach and Bourn Airfield will be carried forward.
Our evidence says that it is reasonable to assume that annual delivery rates at Northstowe
and Waterbeach will be higher than so far relied on, meaning that more of the planned
homes will be completed in the plan period, with less to follow after 2041.
Notwithstanding, the updated policies will provide positive opportunities for enhanced
development densities around transport hubs, whilst taking account of other policies in the
plan. This could result in additional development over and above that currently permitted but
at this stage no further development is assumed in the housing supply from this potential
additional source.
Why is this policy needed?
To provide a context for the ongoing development of existing planned new settlements during
the plan period. Early phases of Northstowe are under construction. The new settlements
on Land north of Waterbeach and at Bourn Airfield have gained, or the council has resolved
to grant, planning permission. However, for all three new settlements there will be detailed
stages of the planning process happening over years to come. The policy context provided
by the 2018 Local Plan is still needed.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Planning permissions for the new settlements of Waterbeach and Bourn Airfield include trip
budgets and processes in place to monitor transport impacts to ensure that transport impacts
are mitigated as each stage of development is built. This approach will continue to apply.
The new settlements will be built over the life of the new plan, and well beyond. During that
time as sustainable transport links are completed and improved, there may be opportunities
to increase densities in areas with good access to these transport hubs, and the plan should
be supportive of this, subject to other policies in the plan.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
We did not ask any specific questions in the First Conversation on this issue. However, we
did ask about creating further new settlements as part of the development strategy, and a
number of comments highlighted that we should focus on completing these existing new
settlements. We received some proposals in the call for sites for further new settlements, but
as set out the development strategy (S/DS) we do not think further new settlements should
be part of the development strategy
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, rely on district wide policies for these areas – Not considered a reasonable
alternative, as it is considered that area specific detail needs to be included in the new plan.

2.5       The rural southern cluster
The south of Cambridge, between the M11 and the A1307, is home to a range of major
business parks with world-leading facilities, and has some excellent and improving public
transport links. We want to support this business cluster through ensuring that more
business space is provided where needed, and through a limited amount of new housing in
and around villages that are well-connected to jobs by public transport, cycling and walking
facilities. We believe that a case can be madefor exceptional circumstances to release some
limited areas of Green Belt land here, as new development in this location will generate less
carbon emissions from car use.

                                                     this?
The rural southern cluster provides an opportunity to locate homes near jobs, and support
the development of the important employment sites in this area. There are also existing
and planned public transport opportunities to access Cambridge, helping to minimise
traffic and related carbon emissions. This option most closely connects to Strategic Green
Infrastructure Initiative 3: Gog Magog Hills and Chalkland Fringe.

■   Proposals for B2 (industry) and B8 (warehousing) uses will need to be justified by a
    needs assessment which sets out the specific requirements of the intended occupier to
    locate onto the site
■   Requiring supporting uses to consider impact in terms of vitality and viability on local or
    minor rural centres in the area.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
■   Enabling opening up of the Campus to members of the public, as part of delivering wider
    social benefits.
■   Ensuring environmental and other impacts are fully considered by any future proposals.
Why is this policy needed?
The Genome Campus, Hinxton is set within and adjacent to the estate of Hinxton Hall on
125-acres of landscaped parkland bordering the River Cam. The Campus is the world’s
leading centre for genomics research, having played a central role in the Human Genome
Project (1990-2003), which read and recorded the complete sequence of DNA in an
individual for the first time.
In 2020 South Cambridgeshire District Council granted planning permission for a mixed-use
development which would provide up to a further 150,000 square metres of new research
and translation floorspace. The Wellcome Trust want the Campus to become an international
centre for scientific, business, cultural and educational activities arising from genomes and
biodata. It estimates that around 4,300 new jobs will be created by the expansion of the
campus. The jobs will be accompanied by up to 1,500 new homes specifically for Campus
workers, along with a new school, a nursery and community facilities, and public open
spaces and allotments.
The existing site is recognised in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 as an
‘Established Employment Area in the Countryside’. However, given the scale and range of
uses now permitted within the site, and as a major expansion to it, a new policy is needed.
The planning permission for the development includes a range of requirements and criteria
designed to recognise the unique nature of the site and ensure future uses support the
primary role of the Genome Campus, and these will be used to inform the development of
the new policy.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – without a policy designation the area would be within countryside policies, which
would not reflect the scale of change taking place in the area or provide a suitable context for
future proposals within the site.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
   ■   Protect and enhance the landscaped setting of the site
   ■   Preserve the appearance of the conservation areas, and the setting of the Grade II
       Listed Babraham Hall and the Grade I Listed St Peters Church.
   ■   Protect and enhance the corridor of the River Granta (recognised as a county
       wildlife site)
   ■   Take steps to include sustainable travel opportunities, including the opportunities
       provided by the planned Cambridge South East Transport Scheme.
   ■   Retain the area of The Close as key worker and affordable housing to support the
       needs of the Campus. Any future renovation or replacement should retain the low
       density character, which responds to the sensitive village edge location.
Why is this policy needed?
The Babraham Research Campus is one of the UK’s leading centres for bioscience
innovation, and lies within the countryside and Green Belt to the south-east of Cambridge
and on the north-west side of the village of Babraham. The campus comprises a range
of research and development buildings located on the north-west and south-east side of
Babraham Hall, a 19th century Grade II Listed Building situated within a 450 acre parkland
setting.
National planning policy is clear that once established, Green Belt boundaries should only be
altered where there are exceptional circumstances, where this is fully evidenced and justified
through the preparation or updating of plans.
Allocation of land in this location responds to need identified in the Greater Cambridge
Employment Land Review and Economic Development Evidence Base (2020), in a location
best able to respond to the specific needs of the life sciences cluster.
The Campus has a distinct and unique set of characteristics, not available anywhere else
at other research facilities in the sub-region, and has benefited from significant public
investment. The campus is important to the development of UK life sciences, in particular
supporting start-up and scale-up bioscience companies.
The Cambridge Green Belt Study (2021) identifies that the Campus makes a relatively
limited contribution to Green Belt purposes, and the harm of its release would be low. The
study highlights that harm could be ameliorated by the enhancement of existing hedgerows
and woodland that forms the boundaries of the site, particularly to the east and west. This
would also help ensure that development enhances existing landscape features, including
parkland features, and is in keeping with the wider wooded character.
Reflecting that the purpose of the release is to support the unique work of the campus and
its high quality environment, it is proposed that a criteria based policy be prepared so that
this is reflected in any future proposals for the site.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Continuing existing allocations
Housing
The following allocation which is included within the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018
is proposed to be carried forward into the new Greater Cambridge Local Plan:
■   S/RSC/H/1 (c): land south of Babraham Road, Sawston (Part of the site is in Babraham
    Parish)
A map showing the boundary of this allocation can be found at the end of this document.
Allocations not proposed to be carried forward
The following allocations are not proposed to be carried forward for the reasons set out below:
Housing
■   Dales Manor Business Park, Sawston (H1/a): much of the site has been taken forward
    for redevelopment as employment land, making it no longer available for housing.
■   Land north of Babraham Road, Sawston (H1/b): the housing development is under
    construction.
Employment
■   Pampisford: West of Eastern Counties Leather, London Road (E/4:2) – the Greater
    Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development Evidence Study (November
    2020) recommends that the allocation is no longer required, as the wider area has been
    substantially developed.
Why is this policy needed?
The rural southern cluster area provides the opportunity to provide new homes that are close
to the research parks and potentially in locations with sustainable transport opportunities, as
well as potential for further local employment opportunities.
To help support this aim, we looked for new sites in all Rural Centres, Minor Rural Centres
and Group villages within the southern cluster area that have either or both of a Greater
Cambridge Partnership Cambridge South Eastern Transport Scheme stop or mainline
railway station, and considered the findings of the Housing & Employment Land Availability
Assessment, including the environmental impacts of possible sites.
Most of these villages are located within Green Belt. The Councils consider that the
carbon benefits of locating homes close to jobs in the research parks, where there are
existing opportunities for very high quality sustainable travel, could provide the exceptional

                                                     Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
circumstances required to justify removing land from the Green Belt in this location but only if
considered alongside the environmental impacts.
Two new suitable sites have been identified for new homes, one of which is in the Green
Belt.
For employment, the Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development
Evidence Study (ELR) (GL Hearn, with SQW, Cambridge Econometrics, and Iceni Projects)
identifies demand for start-up and grow on space in both the Life Science and ICT sectors,
two of Greater Cambridge’s key sectors. Using the same approach as for considering new
sites for housing, we identified one small new employment opportunity.
The adopted South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 includes a number of land allocations
at villages in the rural southern cluster area. Most of these have been developed, gained
planning permission or are being progressed, and therefore it is no longer necessary to
include a policy framework for their development in the Local Plan. Land south of Babraham
Road, Sawston is at the start of the planning application process, and therefore a policy
framework needs to be retained for this site. However, this will be kept under review as the
plan progresses.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
This is the first formal consultation on these proposed housing sites.
What alternatives did we consider?
We considered a range of alternative sites within the southern cluster area having regard to
the overarching development strategy and conclusions of the Housing & Employment Land
Availability Assessment. We discounted sites considered to be less suitable for development.

Continuing existing policy area
S/SCP/L H/6 South of A1307, Linton
To maintain the policy approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 which
restricts residential development in the area of Linton south of the A1307 to improvements
to existing properties.
A map showing the boundary of this existing policy area can be found at the end of this document.
Why is this policy needed?
Whittlesford Parkway Station Area, Whittlesford Bridge
Whittlesford Parkway Station has good connections to both Cambridge and London, is
close to the southern cluster research and employment centres, and is predicted to see
further growth in passengers in the coming years. The station area incorporates a range of
existing uses including existing employment, a few homes, Whittlesford Highways Depot and
Whittlesford Station Car Park.
                                                                                   119

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
In recent years, Greater Cambridge Partnership has explored potential transport
infrastructure around the station and its surroundings to enable it to cater for future increased
demand and to shift trips away from the car, via the Greater Cambridge Partnership’s
Whittlesford Masterplanning Exercise. This exercise also included considering the
potential for new employment and homes in this area. At its meeting of 19 February 2020
the GCP Executive Board agreed to support a draft delivery plan for the Whittlesford Station
Transport Investment Strategy as a basis for further engagement with key stakeholders.
Separately to the Masterplanning Exercise, a small site in the centre of the Whittlesford
Parkway Station Area was submitted to the Local Plan process for housing via the Call for
Sites. We don’t think that developing this small site in isolation would be appropriate, and
would prefer to see the whole area considered in a comprehensive manner, to ensure that
redevelopment opportunities support the sustainable transport improvements included in
the Whittlesford Station Transport Investment Strategy. The full area has not been submitted
to the Local Plan process and as such we don’t currently have evidence that a specific
allocation would be deliverable, which is why we are proposing it as a policy area.
The Red Lion Inn and the Chapel of the Hospital of St John the Baptist Listed Buildings
are located in the south west part of the proposed policy area, and the design of any
development will need to protect and enhance their historic significance.
South of A1307, Linton
The southern part of Linton is severed from the rest of the village by the A1307, which
provides a barrier to easy movement. The area is characterised by three distinct uses:
employment, a sensitive residential area much of which lies within the Conservation Area,
and the site of Linton Zoo. Its location means that whilst there is a pelican crossing providing
a safe crossing point and access to a bus stop on the Cambridge facing side of the main
road, the area generally has poor access to the village facilities and services.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on these issues in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
Whittlesford Parkway Station Area, Whittlesford Bridge:
■  Not to include a policy – This is not the preferred approach as this would not support the
   redevelopment opportunity that exists in this location.
■  Allocate the area for specified development amounts and uses – This is not the preferred
   approach as we don’t currently have evidence that the whole area is available for
   development.

South of A1307, Linton: Not include a policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as it
is necessary to set out within a policy that land south of the A1307 is not a suitable location
for new residential development due to it being severed from the services and facilities within
the village.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
2.6        Rest of the rural area
We want our rural villages to continue to thrive and sustain their local services, but we don’t
want to encourage lots of new homes in places where car travel is the easiest or only way to
get around. We therefore propose some development in and around villages that have good
transport links and services, while in smaller villages, we propose that only small-scale infill
development and affordable housing would be permitted. Any development in and around
villages needs to be well-designed for the rural setting, with a strong relationship to landscape.
How
        have
                 the
                       themes
                                    influenced
                                                      this?
Providing a limited amount of development in the rest of the rural area can help meet the
specific needs of specific employment sectors, support delivery of a range of types and sizes
of housing across the Greater Cambridge area, and can support the social sustainability
of villages and help support community aspirations. As stated in Development Strategy
section (S/DS) this must be balanced with the implications for climate change of distributing
development.

Continuing existing allocations
The following allocations which are included within the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan
2018 are proposed to be carried forward into the new Greater Cambridge Local Plan.
Maps showing the boundaries of these continuing allocations can be found at the end of this
document.
Housing
■   S/RRA/H/1 (d): Land north of Impington Lane, Histon & Impington
Employment
■   S/RRA/E/5(1): Norman Way, Over (1.7 ha.)
■   S/RRA/H/2: Bayer CropScience Site, Hauxton – with an amended boundary to include
    only the area for employment (class E (g)) uses, as all the new homes on this site have
    been completed.
Mixed Use
■   S/RRA/H/3: Fulbourn and Ida Darwin Hospitals
Allocations not proposed to be carried forward
The following allocations are not proposed to be carried forward for the reasons set out
below:
Housing
■   H1/e: Land off New Road and rear of Victoria Way, Melbourn – the development is either
    completed or under construction.
■   H1/f: Green End Industrial Estate, Gamlingay – the development is under construction.
■   H1/g: Land east of Rockmill End, Willingham – the development is under construction.
■   H1/h: Land at Bennell Farm, Comberton (In Toft Parish) – the development is under
    construction.
Employment
■   E/4:1: Longstanton: North of Hattons Road up to the bypass – this site was first identified
    in the 1993 Local Plan, as part of the Home Farm development. It has not come forward
    for employment uses, and does not warrant continued allocation given the alternative
    sites available. However, part of the site is being proposed as a new policy area for
    residential development and open space (see S/RRP/L).
■   E/5:2: Papworth Everard: Ermine Street South – the development has been completed.
                                                                                    133

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
Housing in the rest of the rural area outside the southern cluster can help support delivery of
a range of smaller sites within the area, and support the vitality of our villages.
To help support this aim, we looked for new sites within the rest of the rural area in all Rural
Centres, Minor Rural Centres, or Group villages where they have a mainline railway station,
are on Cambridgeshire Busway or on the route of planned public transport improvements,
and considered the findings of the Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment,
including the environmental impacts of possible sites. Some of these villages are located
within Green Belt. The Councils consider that the carbon benefits of locating homes close to
existing opportunities for very high quality sustainable travel, could provide the exceptional
circumstances required to justify removing land from the Green Belt in this location but only if
considered alongside the environmental impacts.
For employment, we considered the evidence from our Greater Cambridge Employment
Land Review & Economic Development Evidence Base (2020) to understand the locational
demand of different sectors. We then reviewed site opportunities to identify the preferred
list of sites. The site selection was informed by the Housing & Employment Land Availability
Assessment, and taking into account sustainable travel opportunities alongside the likely
travel requirements of the proposed uses. We identified land that could respond to the need
for local warehousing and distribution with good access to the highway network. We also
identified some small-scale opportunities in accessible locations which could add the mix
and types of land available.
The adopted South Cambridgeshire Local Plan includes a number of land allocations at
villages. Most of these have been developed, gained planning permission or are being
progressed, and therefore it is no longer necessary to include a policy framework for their
development in the Local Plan. A few are still to be brought forward or are still going through
the planning process, and therefore a policy framework needs to be retained for these sites.
However, this will be kept under review as the plan progresses.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on this issue in the First Conversation consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
We considered a range of alternative sites within the rest of the rural area having regard to
the overarching development strategy and the conclusions of the Housing and Employment
Land Availability Assessment. We discounted sites considered to be less suitable for
development.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy S/RRP: Policy areas in the rest of the
rural area
What will this policy do?
Guide development for one new and five existing policy areas within the rest of the rural area
outside the rural southern cluster area.
Proposed policy direction
New policy area
S/RRP/L: East of bypass, Longstanton
We propose to provide a new policy framework for future development proposals in this area
of Longstanton that is the last remaining area from the original Home Farm development that
secured the delivery of the Longstanton Bypass.
This new policy area will replace the longstanding allocations that were carried forward
into the 2018 South Cambridgeshire Local Plan that had preceded the building of the
Longstanton Bypass. These were for an employment development that extended beyond the
eventual alignment of the road and an area for the extension of the recreation ground. The
revised policy area is to only include land lying within the line of the bypass. It is intended
that part of this land will continue to provide for new open space, whilst the employment use
is proposed to be replaced with provision of new supported housing. This will be explored
in the preparation of the draft plan but could include for example affordable housing, older
persons housing and sheltered housing, and look at the potential to support the completion
of community facilities in the village.
We will continue to develop proposals for this area for the draft Local Plan stage.

Existing policy areas proposed to be carried forward. Maps showing the boundaries of these
continuing policy areas can be found at the end of this document.
S/RRP/E/7: Imperial War Museum, Duxford
The policy will continue to guide future development proposals at the Imperial War Museum,
Duxford.
We propose to continue the policy approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018,
which identifies the Imperial War Museum site at Duxford Airfield as a special case as a
museum which is a major tourist / visitor attraction, educational and commercial facility.
Proposals will be considered with regard to the particular needs and opportunities of the site
and any proposals involving the use of the estate and its facilities for museum uses or non-
museum uses must be complementary to the character, vitality and sustainability of the site
as a branch of the Imperial War Museum.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
S/RRP/H/4: Papworth Everard West Central
The policy will continue to guide redevelopment and re-use of buildings and land within the
centre of Papworth Everard.
We propose to maintain the policy approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018
which seeks to deliver the continued reinvigoration of the village centre and the provision of
a mix of uses.
S/RRP/E/6: Papworth Hospital
The policy will continue to guide redevelopment and re-use of the former Papworth Hospital site.
If still needed when the new plan reaches later stages, we propose to maintain the policy
approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 that applies a sequential approach
to finding replacement uses for the site beginning with healthcare, and then more general
employment uses, with residential limited to conversions of character buildings where it
would be the most appropriate use.
S/RRP/H/5: Fen Drayton Former Land Settlement Association Estate
This policy will continue to guide the redevelopment / re-use of land and buildings within the
former LSA estate at Fen Drayton.
We propose to maintain the policy approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018.
This allowed for the replacement of existing building floorspace with residential development
of very high environmental standards.
S/RRP/E/8: Mixed Use Development in Histon & Impington Station Area
The policy will continue to guide further redevelopment in the area around the former station.
We propose to maintain the policy approach in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018
which seeks to deliver the redevelopment of land around the former station and the provision
of a mix of uses.
Why is this policy needed?
There are a range of existing policy areas within the rest of the rural area outside of the rural
southern cluster, which provide context for the development of specific locations responding
to specific local circumstances.
East of bypass, Longstanton
This area is the last remaining area from the original Home Farm development that secured
the delivery of the Longstanton Bypass. The proposed policy direction is intended to support

the aims of Longstanton Parish Council for new open space, community facilities, and
additional affordable housing.
Imperial War Museum, Duxford
The Imperial War Museum site at Duxford Airfield is a major tourist / visitor attraction, educational
and commercial facility. It is of national significance, and requires a clear policy approach
recognising both the sensitivity of the site but also the importance of allowing it to evolve.
Papworth Everard West Central
The area contains a number of buildings that have reached the end of their structural life, or
that are not currently in use. Rather than piecemeal development, there is an opportunity for
considerable environmental improvement, and benefit to the functioning of the village, if a
coordinated approach is taken to its development. It is important to ensure that a mix of uses
is achieved on this significant site, and that it does not become purely residential led.
Papworth Hospital
Papworth Hospital has relocated to a new building on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus at
Addenbrooke’s, and therefore the former hospital site in Papworth Everard is now vacant.
The hospital provided over 1,000 jobs in the village and therefore the loss of employment
from the hospital site will have had a significant impact on the economy of the village, and
the ability of people to find work locally. A healthcare use would achieve the continuance of
the mutually beneficial relationship between hospital and village. Other employment uses on
the hospital site would at least maintain a balance between homes and jobs in the village,
but would not provide the current jobs profile, make best use of the existing resources, or
reflect the history and character of the village.
Fen Drayton Former Land Settlement Association Estate
The Land Settlement Association (LSA) was created in the 1930s to carry out an
experimental scheme for the provision of smallholdings for unemployed persons, with
financial assistance from the Government. The legacy of the experiment is a network of
smallholdings with dwellings along the road frontages, a collection of glasshouses and
outbuildings in varying states of repair, and large areas of unused land.
As set out in the climate change theme, building standards across the whole area are now
catching up, so new proposals will not be so ground-breaking. However, it is considered that
a policy is still needed to provide a context for this area.
                                                                                        139

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Mixed Use Development in Histon & Impington Station Area
The Council received a proposal from Histon and Impington Parish Council during the
preparation of the adopted Local Plan that sought to proactively design a special area in
Histon and Impington around the former station, which is now a stop on the Guided Busway.
This would encourage sensitive redevelopment of this area and stimulate commercial activity
and encourage local employment. This approach was supported in the Histon & Impington
Neighbourhood Plan.
Some proposals have come forward for sites within the area, but other sites are still going
through the planning application process or have not yet come forward.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific consultation on these issues in the First Conversation consultation.
Regarding the Imperial War Museum, IWM Duxford indicated their support for continuing
the policy approach, with a request that in future it could potentially be supported by a
Supplementary Planning Document providing a masterplan for the site.
What alternatives did we consider?
East of bypass, Longstanton
No policy, and rely on normal policies elsewhere in the plan - This alternative is not
considered a reasonable alternative as it would not support holistic development of this area.
Imperial War Museum, Duxford
No policy, and rely on normal policies elsewhere in the plan – This alternative is not
considered a reasonable alternative as the museum is of national importance, and needs an
appropriate policy framework to enable its continued evolution.
Papworth Everard West Central
Not include a policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach as there is a risk that
without a policy all proposals brought forward for the reuse or redevelopment of vacant
buildings or land within the centre of the village will be for residential uses. It is important that
the centre of the village includes a mix of uses including community and employment uses.
Papworth Hospital
1. Having no policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach, as due to the scale of
the now redundant site, a policy context is required.

2. Allocate hospital area for residential development – This alternative is not considered a
reasonable alternative due to the desire to maintain employment levels in the village with the
loss of the hospital.
3. Allocate hospital area for employment without the preference for healthcare uses – This
alternative is not considered a reasonable alternative due to the opportunities provided by
the current site, and local workforce.
Fen Drayton Former Land Settlement Association Estate
No Policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach as this would mean the area was
addressed by normal countryside policies.
Mixed Use Development in Histon & Impington Station Area
Not include a policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach as development of this
area is still underway, and the approach is supported in the neighbourhood plan..

3.1       Climate Change
In the First Conversation in 2020, you told us that climate change was your highest priority
theme. You asked for the Plan to set ambitious targets for carbon reduction, and you
stressed how important water conservation is to you. There was also a desire from some of
those who responded for a degree of flexibility in policies, to allow for changes in approach
and technologies during the timescale of the plan.
Our aim for our climate change policies
Help Greater Cambridge transition to net zero carbon by 2050, by ensuring that development
is sited in places that help to limit carbon emissions, is designed to the highest achievable
standards for energy and water use, and is resilient to current and future climate risks.

Responding to climate change has been an important factor in determining where future
development should be located, and how it should be built.
The UK has a legally binding requirement to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, with the
recently adopted sixth carbon budget, which was translated into law in June 2021, requires
63% reduction in emissions from 2019 to 2035 (78% relative to 1990). Alongside the national
carbon budget, the Tyndall Carbon Budget Reports can be used to identify area based
carbon budgets. Using this methodology, our evidence base suggests a carbon budget for
Greater Cambridge of 11 million tonnes (MtCO2) for the period 2020-2100. Achievement
of these budgets requires action across all sectors, including the built environment. In
addition, Section 182 of the Planning Act places a legal duty on local planning authorities to
ensure that their development plan documents include policy to secure the contribution of
development and the use of land in the mitigation and adaptation of climate change.
Planning is not just concerned with buildings themselves but place making, and as such
has the potential to be a powerful tool in the response to the climate emergency. Achieving
net zero carbon status cuts across all elements of place making; not just how homes and
                                                                                      143

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
buildings are designed and constructed, but also by ensuring new development is located
where it is or can be served by low carbon transport links, like public transport, cycling
and walking. Our spatial strategy has been informed by carbon assessment that highlights
the impact that transport emissions can have, and promotes patterns of development that
enable low carbon transport modes, shifting away from a reliance on private cars. Policies
related to transport are covered in the infrastructure theme and include measures to support
sustainable transport as well as the transition to low emissions vehicles.
Our proposed policy approaches also seek to adapt to climate change. They require
developments to avoid flood risk areas, and to not increase flood risk elsewhere. Buildings
and places should also be designed not just for efficient heating, but also to keep cool in the
summer.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Green Infrastructure – open space including food growing opportunities as well as the role
of open spaces and habitats such as peatlands in helping our communities adapt to our
changing climate through flood storage, carbon storage and helping to cool our cities, towns
and villages.
Infrastructure – Includes policy proposals related to sustainable travel and electricity infrastructure.
What policies are we proposing?
CC/NZ: Net zero carbon new buildings
CC/WE: Water efficiency in new developments
CC/DC: Designing for a changing climate
CC/FM: Flooding and integrated water management
CC/RE: Renewable energy projects and infrastructure
CC/CE: Reducing waste and supporting the circular economy

Policy CC/NZ: Net zero carbon new buildings
What will this policy do?
This policy will set the levels of energy use that will be allowed for new development, how
renewable energy should be used to meet that energy need, and how whole-life carbon
emissions (emissions associated with constructing buildings), should be taken into account.
Proposed policy direction
That the policy set specific requirements regarding the energy needs of new buildings and
how renewable energy should be used to generate that energy requirement. For those
developments unable to meet those requirements fully on-site, the use of a carbon offset
mechanism, which would be used to invest in additional renewable energy generation, is
proposed. Consideration is also given to the carbon associated with the construction process
and the materials used to construct new buildings, known as embodied carbon, as well as
reducing the difference between designed performance and as built performance, known as
the performance gap, using Assured Performance processes.
The technical requirements proposed below have been informed by our Net Zero Carbon
Study (2021).
Net Zero Carbon Buildings – operational emissions
 1.  Part A: All housing and non-domestic buildings should achieve a specific space heating
      demand as follows:
       a.  All new dwellings should have a space heating demand of 15-20 kWh per meter
           squared per year
       b.  All non-domestic buildings should achieve a space heating demand of 15-20 kWh
           per meter squared per year
 2.  All heating should be provided through low carbon fuels (not fossil fuels).
 3.  No new developments should be connected to the gas grid.
 4.  Part B: Total Energy Use Intensity (EUI) targets are achieved as per building type (set out
      in kWh per m2 per year), as follows:
       a.  All dwellings should achieve an EUI of no more than 35 kWh per m² per year.
       b.  Non domestic buildings should achieve the following EUI of no more than the
           following, where technically feasible, by building type:
        ■   Offices: 55 kWh per m2 per year
        ■   Schools: 65 kWh per m2 per year
        ■   Multi-residential (e.g. student accommodation): 35 kWh per m2 per year
        ■   Retail: 55 kWh per m2 per year
                                                                                     145
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
        ■  Leisure: 100 kWh per m2 per year
        ■  Research facility: 150 kWh per m2 per year
        ■  Higher education teaching facilities: 55 kWh per m2 per year
        ■  Light industrial uses: 110 kWh per m2 per year
        ■  GP surgery: 55 kWh per m2 per year
        ■  Hotel: 55 kWh per m2 per year
 5.  Part C: Proposals should generate at least the same amount of renewable energy
      (preferably on-plot) as they demand over the course of a year. This should include all
      energy use (regulated and unregulated), calculated using a methodology proven to
      accurately predict a building’s actual energy performance.
 6.  Where a development of multiple buildings is concerned, the renewable energy
      generation requirement should be calculated and demonstrated across the whole
      development so that buildings that are able to exceed the requirements do so in order to
      compensate for any buildings onsite that cannot meet the requirements.
 7.  Part D: Offsetting to only be used in certain circumstances (e.g. insufficient roof space
      to generate renewable energy) – money would only be used to invest in additional
      renewable energy generation to ensure net zero carbon buildings are delivered. Where a
      proposal cannot meet the requirements in full, in addition to offsetting, the development
      must be futureproofed to enable future occupiers to easily retrofit or upgrade
      buildings and/or infrastructure in the future to enable achievement of net zero carbon
      development.
 8.  All developments must demonstrate use of an assured performance method in order to
      ensure that the buildings’ operational energy performance reflects design intentions and
      addresses the performance gap.
Net Zero Carbon Buildings – construction
 9.  Residential developments of 150 homes or more and non-residential development of
      1,000 m² or more should calculate whole life carbon emissions through a nationally
      recognised Whole Life Carbon Assessment and demonstrate actions to reduce life-cycle
      carbon emissions. This should include reducing emissions associated with construction
      plant.
Why is this policy needed?
The UK has a legally binding requirement of net zero carbon by 2050. In June 2021,
government adopted its sixth carbon budget, which forms part of the route map to achieve
net zero carbon by 2050, 63% reduction in emissions from 2019 to 2035 (78% relative to
1990).
Our Net Zero Carbon Study (2021) advises that new buildings need to be built to net
zero carbon as soon as possible for Greater Cambridge to play its part in meeting the

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
UK’s carbon budgets. This will require rapid decarbonisation across all sectors of the UK
economy, including the built environment. Our evidence base makes it very clear that if we
are to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, then new development will need to go further than
the requirements set out in current and future Building Regulations.
The proposed policy deals with all of the carbon associated with new buildings, both that
associated with the energy needed for powering our homes and commercial buildings, as
well as the carbon associated with the processes and materials used to construct those
buildings, known as embodied carbon. Policy CC/CE also gives consideration to what
happens to materials at the end of a buildings life. This is known as whole life carbon. It
also seeks to address the performance gap between designed performance and as built
performance through the use of Assured Performance processes. These are elements that
are not fully covered in other regulations such as Building Regulations.
In terms of the ability for local planning authorities to set policy requirements related to
carbon associated with new buildings, legally, this is something that a Local Plan can do, a
matter confirmed in January 2021, when government issued a response to its consultation
on the Future Homes Standard. As part of the consultation, government had asked whether
it should ‘ban’ local plans from going beyond Building Regulations. But having considered
the responses received, it has decided not to and reconfirmed its position that Local Plans
can set energy standards for new homes that go beyond Building Regulations.
Given the high standards proposed, the sustainable show home policy which is currently
part of the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan will no longer be required. The policy would
also replace the current policy in Cambridge requiring achievement of BREEAM Excellent
for all new non-residential development. The standards contained within the policy and other
policies in the First Proposals are such that they will exceed current BREEAM requirements,
although developers may still choose to utilise BREEAM certification to meet the assured
performance aspects of the policy. Also, it is not proposed to continue with the consequential
improvements policy given the difficulties of implementing this policy via the planning system.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback we received through the First Conversation included support for sustainable and
resilient design for new development including zero carbon, heat pumps, green roofs, green
walls, grey water systems, solar panels. There was support for applying standards such as
Support Passivhaus and BREEAM standards. We should offset carbon emissions from new
development, and consider the impacts of embodied carbon. Others said our policies should
be flexible to allow for innovations during the Plan period, or that we should not set higher
energy performance policies than required nationally.
                                                                                      147

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, leaving the delivery of net zero carbon to Building Regulations and the Future
Homes/Buildings Standard - Not considered a reasonable alternative as it does not fulfil our
statutory duty set out in the Climate Change Act and Planning Act and will not enable Greater
Cambridge to achieve its carbon budget. This approach would also not deliver net zero
carbon in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C trajectory. Building Regulations only considers
regulated energy, whereas in order to achieve net zero carbon, all energy consumption from
new buildings must be met by renewable energy. The Future Homes Standard only requires
new homes to be ‘zero carbon ready’, leaving further carbon reduction to achieve net zero
carbon to home owners, further adding to the retrofit burden and the 28 million homes in
the UK already needing retrofit to achieve net zero carbon by 2050. In addition, the issue of
embodied carbon is not, at present, considered by any other regulatory framework, and there
does not appear to be any plans for it to be considered through Building Regulations. This
leaves a significant policy gap in the delivery of net zero carbon by 2050.

Policy  CC/WE: Water  efficiency  in  new
developments
What will this policy do?
This policy will set the standards of water efficiency that new developments must comply
with.
Proposed policy direction
Developments will be required to meet high standards of water efficiency:
■  Residential developments should be designed to achieve a standard of 80 litres/person/
   day unless demonstrated impracticable.
■  Non-residential development will be required to achieve full credits for category Wat 01 of
   BREEAM unless demonstrated impracticable.
Why is this policy needed?
The Greater Cambridge Integrated Water Management Study (2021) has shown that
the current level of water abstraction from the chalk aquifer is widely believed to be
unsustainable, with potential to cause environmental damage, unless abstraction rates are
reduced significantly to safeguard natural river flow. Whilst water company plans have taken
account of planned growth in the existing local plans, there is no environmental capacity
for additional development in the new Local Plan to be supplied by water by increased
abstraction from the chalk aquifer. Future water demand and supply will need to be balanced
in other ways, such as through reduced usage, reduced leakage, import of water /licence
trading between water companies and the development of new reservoirs at the regional
scale. Water Resources East is coordinating these regional efforts and producing a regional
plan for water.
Many of these solutions are outside the control of the Local Plan, but one way in which the
Local Plan can reduce the demand for water is by requiring high levels of water efficiency
in all new developments. The adopted 2018 Local Plan policies require 110 litres/person/
day, which is the lower optional requirement allowed by Building Regulations. It is proposed
to go further than that and include a policy requiring 80 litres/person/day in all new housing
development. This is the equivalent of the Code for Sustainable Homes Level 5/6 (now
withdrawn) and which was the design standard for the University’s development at Eddington
in North West Cambridge. An equally water efficient level is proposed for non-residential
developments of full credits for category Wat 01 of BREEAM (the current level in Cambridge
Local Plan policy).
The Integrated Water Management Study (IWMS) has shown that 80 litres/person/day is
                                                                                      149

achievable by making full use of water efficient fixtures and fittings, and also water re-use
measures on site including surface water and rainwater harvesting, and grey water recycling.
It also shows that the cost effectiveness improves with the scale of the project, and that a
site-wide system is preferable to smaller installations.
A standard of 80 l/p/d goes beyond what Local Authorities are currently able to require (as
set out in the Deregulation Act 2015), but the Councils consider that there is a strong case
for greater water efficiency in Greater Cambridge based on the strong evidence provided by
the Integrated Water Management Study. Increased standards of water efficiency for Greater
Cambridge are also supported in principle by Cambridge Water, Water Resources East, and
the Environment Agency.
The Shared regional principles for protecting, restoring and enhancing the
environment in the Oxford-Cambridge Arc are clear that they will encourage local
partners to exceed minimum standards required by building regulations on issues such as
water consumption, and that they will be working with Government on this issue.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback received during the First Conversation consultation expressed concern about the
level for water abstraction from the chalk aquifer south of Cambridge, and that water should
be sourced more sustainably. We should use water resources efficiently and include more
ambitious water consumption targets. There were suggestions of 75 and 80 litres per person
per day. There was support for rainwater harvesting and grey water use in new development,
and some suggestions that this should be mandatory.
What alternatives did we consider?
For residential:
■   No policy – rely on standard Building Regulations (125 litres per person per day) - Not
    considered a reasonable alternative as it would not respond to the level of water stress in
    the area.
■   Implement the Building Regulations alternative standard (the current policy of 110 litres/
    person/day) - This is not the preferred approach as whilst this does seek to reduce water
    use, the level of reduction is not sufficient to respond to the pressure on water resources
    in the area.
For non-residential:
■   No policy – there is currently no standard in Building Regulations for water efficiency in
    non-residential developments - Not considered a reasonable alternative as it would not
    respond to the level of water stress in the area.

    BREEAM unless demonstrated not practicable (current policy in the adopted South

    does seek to reduce water use, the level of reduction is not sufficient to respond to the

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy CC/DC: Designing for a changing
climate
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how the design of developments should take account of our changing
climate, for example extreme weather events such as heat waves and flash flooding.
Proposed policy direction
All new dwellings must be designed to achieve a low overheating risk using the Good
Homes Alliance Overheating in New Homes Tool and Guidance, with more detailed
modelling required for schemes identified as being ‘at risk’, using future climate scenarios
such as those provided by 2050 Prometheus weather data for Cambridge.
All non-domestic buildings must be designed to achieve a low overheating risk using the
cooling hierarchy, with more detailed modelling required for major developments using future
climate scenarios such as those provided by 2050 Prometheus weather data for Cambridge.
All developments should take a design led approach to climate change adaptation with
approaches integrated into architectural design. For overheating, proposals should follow the
cooling hierarchy as follows:
   a.  Passive design: minimise internal heat generation through energy efficient design
       and reduction of heat entering the building through consideration of orientation,
       overhangs and external shading, albedo, fenestration, insulation and green roofs.
   b.  Passive/natural cooling: use of outside air, where possible pre-cooled by soft
       landscaping, a green roof or by passing it underground to ventilate and cool a
       building without the use of a powered system. Cross ventilation, passive stack and
       wind driven ventilation should be maximised and single aspect dwellings must be
       avoided for all schemes as effective passive ventilation can be difficult or impossible
       to achieve. Windows and/or ventilation panels must be designed to allow effective
       and secure ventilation.
   c.  Mixed mode cooling: with local mechanical ventilation/cooling provided where
       needed to supplement the above measures using low energy mechanical cooling
   d.  Full building mechanical ventilation/cooling system, ensuring the lowest carbon/
       energy options and only considered after all other elements of the hierarchy have
       been utilised.
All development proposals must utilise site wide approaches to reduce climate risks,
including the integration of sustainable drainage systems as part of landscape design, the

use of cool materials and urban greening, for example through increased tree canopy cover
and an enhanced treescape and integrating green spaces into new developments.
Why is this policy needed?
The Planning Act requires Local Plans to have policies related to climate change mitigation
and adaptation. At the same time as reducing carbon emissions, we must not lose sight of
the fact that our climate is already changing as a result of past emissions. Extreme weather
events including flooding and heat waves are now becoming common place, and as such
we need to ensure that all new developments are adaptable to this changing climate, in
ways which do not increase energy use and associated carbon emissions. Overheating,
particularly in new residential buildings is becoming an increasing problem with climate
change, with potentially serious consequences to health and life. Overheating risks can and
should be mitigated through consideration of various factors at early design stages at low or
no cost.
Analysis from the Committee on Climate Change has shown that a lack of adaptation
measures in new homes built in England over the past 5 years has led to many new homes
not being resilient to future high temperatures. This will require costly retrofit to make them
safe and habitable. They recommend that planning policy must change to ensure that further
homes are not locked in to increased climate vulnerability. In addition to policy CC/DC, policy
CC/FM gives consideration to flooding and sustainable water management. There are also
links to our design policies in the Great Places chapter, in order to ensure that measures to
reduce climate risks are integrated into the design of new developments from the outset.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback received during the First Conversation consultation included support for policy
related to overheating in new developments. There was support for an approach that
requires developments to respond to the most up to date risks identified by the Climate
Change Committee and that demonstrates a clear adaptation strategy. We should take
account of more frequent and intense flood events and water stress in the region. Adaptation
policies need enough flexibility to accommodate and adapt to the fast-paced evolution of
technology. Guidance on retrofitting adaptation measures would be welcomed.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, rely on national guidance – Not considered a reasonable alternative, as local
planning authorities have a legal duty to include policies related to both climate change
mitigation and adaptation, as contained within the Planning Act.
                                                                                      153

Policy CC/FM: Flooding and integrated water
management
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how development should address flood risk and implement integrated
water management including sustainable drainage systems in new development.
Proposed policy direction
Development will be directed to the areas with the least likelihood of flooding from all sources
and taking into account climate change (the policy will not need to repeat aspects covered by
the National Planning Policy Framework).
Developments will be required to provide integrated water management, including
sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), where surface water is managed close to its source
and on the surface where reasonably practicable to do so. SuDS and green /brown roofs
should provide multiple benefits (such as biodiversity and amenity). All hard surfaces must
be permeable where reasonably practicable. Appropriate measures for future management
will need to be demonstrated and secured.
                                                                                    155

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Potential flood risk to developments will need to be fully addressed including demonstrating
development is resilient or adaptive to flooding. Flood management policies will require that
the risk of flooding is not increased elsewhere as a result of new development. The plan will
set out the approach to runoff rates, including that peak runoff rate should be no greater for
the developed site than it was for the undeveloped site.
Why is this policy needed?
In line with national planning policy, new development should be located in the areas of
lowest flood risk where possible and should not increase flood risk elsewhere. A Greater
Cambridge Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) (2021) has been prepared
which identifies areas that may flood from all sources including rivers, surface water,
groundwater, sewers and reservoirs. It also shows the potential impact of climate change
on these areas of flood risk. The SFRA has been used to inform the selection of sites for
allocation for development.
This policy is needed to supplement national policy with local considerations, and to ensure
that water is managed sustainably. The measures used will vary depending upon the scale of
the development but the diagram (on the previous page) shows the possible components of
on-site integrated water management, the linkages and the benefits.
A key component of managing surface water are sustainable drainage systems (SuDS).
SuDs re-create the benefits of natural drainage systems and collect, store, slow and treat
the quality of surface water to mitigate the impacts of development on run-off rates, volumes
and quality. SuDS also have multiple benefits, such as enhancing biodiversity and creating
amenity space with health and well-being benefits. Any water collected should be re-used
wherever possible, which will provide additional water supply and will be key to achieving a
high level of water efficiency in developments (also see CC/WE on water efficiency).
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation consultation said that we should avoid developing in
flood risk areas. The new Local Plan should adapt to the effects of climate change through
being prepared for increased flood risks. Development should be resilient or adapted to
flooding. Flood management policies should ensure that the risk of flooding in the area is not
increased as a result of new development. Sustainable water management and permeable
external surfaces were supported.

Policy CC/RE: Renewable energy projects
and infrastructure
What will this policy do?
This policy will control how renewable energy generation projects and associated
infrastructure should be planned and designed.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will:
  1.  Provide a positive policy framework for the development of stand-alone renewable
      energy projects including associated infrastructure such as battery storage and
      upgrades to grid capacity;
  2.  Identify broad areas of potential suitability for different types of renewable energy,
      informed by Cambridgeshire Renewables Infrastructure Framework and a Landscape
      Sensitivity Assessment;
  3.  Indicate support for community led projects.
  4.  Identify a set of criteria which will apply to all renewable energy projects including
      consideration of impacts on:
        i.  Residential amenity and quality of life (resulting from noise, vibrations, shadow
            flicker or visual dominance);
      ii.   Character and appearance of the landscape and surrounding area;
      iii.  Biodiversity, geodiversity and water quality;
      iv.   Historical, archaeological and cultural heritage;
        v.  Highway safety and infrastructure
      vi.   Aviation, telecommunications or other essential infrastructure (including the Mullard
            radio telescope)
     vii.   The capacity of the landscape to accommodate renewable energy projects, the
            ability to mitigate visual intrusion and the cumulative impacts of individual sites.
  5.  In relation to wind energy, require that following community engagement, it can be
      demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by affected local community have
      been fully addressed and the proposal has their backing.
  6.  National planning policy states that in the Green Belt, elements of many renewable
      energy projects will comprise inappropriate development. In such cases developers will
      need to demonstrate very special circumstances if projects are to proceed. Such very
      special circumstances may include the wider environmental benefits associated with
      increased production of energy from renewable sources.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy recognises that to help increase the use and supply of renewable
and low carbon energy, local planning authorities should recognise the responsibility on all
communities to contribute to energy generation from renewable or low carbon sources. At
the same time, national policy places limits on onshore wind generation. For onshore wind
turbines to achieve planning permission, they need to be located in areas deemed suitable
for wind turbines in local plans or neighbourhood plans, and need to receive community
support.
In order to support the transition to net zero carbon and keep Greater Cambridge within its
carbon budget, the Local Plan will need to facilitate both community and commercial scale
renewable energy generation, with a blend of both wind and solar based energy. As part
of the work on the Net Zero Carbon Study (2021), our consultants have considered how
much renewable energy should be generated within the boundaries of Greater Cambridge
by 2050 in order for the area to fairly contribute to the national generation mix. This work
recommends that onshore wind capacity in Greater Cambridge, which is currently lower than
the national average, needs to increase in capacity around 7-fold. The report recommends
that sufficient areas should be identified to accommodate additional renewable energy
projects.
Work is currently underway to assess the sensitivity of the landscapes that make up Greater
Cambridge. This work will help to identify whether there are any broad areas of suitability for
wind turbines and solar farms and what size or scale of proposal may be suitable subject to
other policy requirements, which would then be identified via the policies map.
This policy is also linked to policy CC/NZ, in that for any schemes that require the use of the
offset facility, it will be important to ensure that sites are identified and ready to proceed in
order to ensure that offsetting is not delayed.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
We asked about how should the Local Plan help us achieve net zero carbon by 2050.
Feedback included that we should support renewable energy production, use and
investment. We should support community renewable energy schemes, and district heating.
What alternatives did we consider?
Not identifying areas suitable for wind turbines, leaving it to other types of renewable
energy to contribute towards Greater Cambridge’s share of renewable energy - This is
not the preferred approach, as there is a risk with this approach that this could place a
risk on delivering sufficient renewable energy to meet carbon budgets, which would not
be compatible with net zero carbon given the need for an increase in renewable energy
                                                                                       159

Policy CC/CE: Reducing waste and
supporting the circular economy
What will this policy do?
This policy will control how developers should manage the waste generated by construction,
how new developments should provide for waste and recycling storage and collection, and
how circular economy principles should be considered in development proposals.
Proposed policy direction
During construction, require Construction Environmental Management Plans (CEMP). The
level of information provided in the CEMP should be proportionate to the scale and nature
of the proposed development but should include an outline of the approach to site waste
management and how construction waste will be addressed following the waste hierarchy
and the 5 r’s of waste management: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
All proposals must provide adequate, flexible and easily accessible storage space and
collection systems in line with the requirements of the RECAP Waste Management Design
Guide (or successor documents). Proposals that exceed these requirements or propose
innovative approaches to waste management will be supported.
All major developments should submit a Circular Economy Statement, either as a stand-
alone document or as part of the CEMP, setting out:
■   How materials arising from demolition and remediation works will be reused and/or
    recycled;
■   How the proposals design and construction will reduce material demands and enable
    building materials, components and products to be disassembled and re-used at the end
    of their useful life, following design for disassembly principles.
Why is this policy needed?
Government’s Resources and Waste Strategy (2018) aims to eliminate avoidable wastes of
all types by 2050 in England. This includes waste from all sectors, including construction.
The construction sector is the largest user of materials in the UK and produces the biggest
waste stream in terms of tonnage. Statistics from Defra show that in 2016, 63% (120
million tonnes) of the total waste stream in England (189 million tonnes) was attributed to
construction, demolition and excavation waste, with 60 million tonnes of this (50%) from
construction and demolition. Of this over 90% is recovered, with waste such as concrete,
brick and asphalt being downcycled for future use as aggregates. However this does
beg the question how much of this waste is avoidable and could such waste be reused
for higher value uses? This would help to prevent the need for the manufacture of new
                                                                                    161

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
materials, which is an important element in achieving net zero carbon. Furthermore efficient
recycling of waste places less demands on natural and virgin resources, thereby conserving
environments.
A circular economy is one where materials are retained in use at their highest value for as
long as possible and are then reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste.
Application of circular economy principles to the built environment creates places where
buildings are designed for adaptation, reconstruction and deconstruction, extending the
useful life of buildings and allowing for the salvage of building components and materials
for reuse or recycling, known as design for disassembly. Policies to extend the useful life
of buildings as well as ensuring that, at the end of a buildings life, its constituent parts are
easily reused and retain maximum value, are also an important element of reducing the
environmental impact of construction. Taking such an approach reduces the need to extract
raw materials and the manufacture of new building components, further reducing global
carbon emissions and assisting with the achievement of net zero carbon.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In the First Conversation we asked about how the Local Plan should help us achieve net
zero carbon by 2050. Feedback of relevance to this policy included that we should consider
a circular economy and require new developments to provide a Circular Economy Statement.
We should support development that prioritises resource efficiency. Other issues were
highlighted including the need to invest in innovative technologies for dealing with waste, and
to improve recycling and use recyclable packaging materials in shops and for development.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, leave to the Minerals and Waste Plan - This is not the preferred approach as the
Minerals and Waste Plan does not give consideration to construction waste and as such
there would be a policy gap in relation to this important element of achieving net zero carbon.

Policy CC/CS: Supporting land-based carbon
sequestration
What will this policy do?
This policy will control development of land that is capable of becoming an important carbon
sink.
Proposed policy direction
Support the creation of land and habitats that play a role as carbon sinks and protect existing
carbon sinks from development in particular undisturbed or undrained peat.
Promote approaches that minimise soil disturbance, compaction and disposal during
construction projects
Why is this policy needed?
Land plays a significant role in climate objectives, acting as both a source of greenhouse gas
emissions and a carbon sink. Peatlands in particular are an important store of carbon, while
other habitats such as woodlands and grasslands also have a role to play, as indicated in
latest research by Natural England. In South Cambridgeshire, peatland is located in the very
north of the district, as identified on the Natural England peatland status maps. Alongside
many other negative impacts, loss and degradation of natural habitats results in the direct
loss of carbon stored within them. Our evidence, alongside the work of the Committee on
Climate Change shows that even after all ambitious carbon reduction actions are taken,
there will still be a proportion of ‘residual’ or unavoidable carbon emissions from the
economy as a whole. Land based carbon sequestration, alongside technological means for
removing carbon from the atmosphere, will have a role to play.
While the role of planning in supporting the development of land for carbon sequestration is
limited, planning policies already exist to protect nature sites, which almost without exception
will act as a carbon sink, and further policies exist to require new development to provide
new open space and deliver biodiversity net gain. Promotion of nature based solutions,
where natural systems are protected, restored and managed can assist with the protection
of carbon sinks while at the same time providing benefits for biodiversity and health and
wellbeing.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
You raised a number of issues related to climate change and land uses, some of which we
have addressed under other policy themes.

To inform the overall strategy for the plan we have been considering the best locations to
restore our area’s habitat networks and provide more green spaces for people to enjoy. Our
Green Infrastructure evidence has identified 14 strategic green infrastructure initiatives to
help achieve this. Our preferred development strategy including draft allocations has been
informed by and incorporates our green infrastructure initiatives. In addition, together with
partner local authorities we have agreed a set of Oxford-Cambridge Arc Environmental
Principles, which have informed our approach to this Theme.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Our green spaces provide many varied benefits for wildlife, people and planet, and this
theme therefore connects with most of the other themes, including for example Climate

Change, which included policies requiring urban greening and sustainable drainage systems
(CC/DC and CC/FM), Great Places, which require our green spaces to respond to their
landscape context (GP/LC) and form part of the overall design of development (GP/PP), and
infrastructure (I/ID), in that green spaces form essential infrastructure to support successful
development.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy BG/BG: Biodiversity and geodiversity
Figure 53: Map of existing nature sites and undesignated green infrastructure
What will this policy do?
This policy will control the biodiversity impacts from development, including the approach
to biodiversity net gain (which requires developers to ensure habitats for wildlife are
enhanced and left in a measurably better state than they were in before development, and
is expressed as a percentage). It will also control development affecting sites of biodiversity
and geodiversity importance.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require development to achieve a minimum 20% biodiversity net gain, noting
that:
■   Biodiversity net gain should be submitted using the Defra Biodiversity Metric 3.0 or its
    successor
■   Biodiversity net gain should be delivered on-site where possible, recognising that
    for smaller developments in particular, more significant and long-lasting biodiversity
  168

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
   enhancements may be achieved via contributions towards off-site, larger scale projects.
■  Where it is agreed that off-site habitat measures would bring greater biodiversity benefits
   than on-site measures, these must be consistent with the strategic aims of the Greater
   Cambridge green infrastructure network strategic initiatives (see BG3)
■  The Councils will seek to use planning conditions to secure on site habitat creation and
   its long-term management, and obligations where BNG is on land outside the applicant’s
   control
The policy will also seek wider environmental net gains. Ways of measuring this are currently
being developed at a national level, and at the draft plan stage we will review whether and
how to implement this policy requirement.
The policy will state that development proposals adversely affecting sites of biodiversity
or geological importance will not normally be permitted. Exceptions will only be made
where the public benefits significantly outweigh any adverse impacts. In such cases where
development is permitted, we will require that the intrinsic natural features of particular
interest are safeguarded or enhanced.
The policy will require development to mitigate evidenced recreational impacts on designated
biodiversity and geodiversity sites, including applying Natural England’s Impact Risk Zones
for Sites of Special Scientific importance.
Why is this policy needed?
National policy requires development to achieve a net gain for biodiversity. Biodiversity
net gain requires developers to ensure habitats for wildlife are enhanced and left in a
measurably better state than they were in before development.
The emerging Environment Bill is likely to introduce a mandatory 10% minimum biodiversity
net gain across the country. At an Oxford-Cambridge Arc level we and our partner authorities
have agreed a set of Arc Environmental Principles which include the aims of doubling the
area of land managed primarily for nature, and also to deliver a minimum 20% biodiversity
net gain on development sites. These ambitions, together with the relatively low level of
designated sites and priority habitats that Greater Cambridge has compared with other
English areas, highlight the need for development to bring further net gains beyond the 10%
proposed nationally.
The focus for biodiversity enhancements is intended to be within the boundary of a site, and
could include providing wildlife areas, trees, or smaller measures such as including bat or
swift boxes. However, If the required level of net gain cannot be provided on site there is the
potential for applicants to contribute to biodiversity enhancements elsewhere – a range of
strategic initiatives have been identified to support biodiversity enhancement across Greater
                                                                                       169

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Cambridge (see BG/GI), meeting national policy requirements to take a strategic approach to
promoting the restoration and enhancement of the green infrastructure network. Ahead of the
draft plan we will work with partners to explore the best way to collect and distribute funds
from development for this purpose.
Beyond biodiversity net gain, national policy encourages local plans to seek wider
environmental gain from development. Approaches for measuring this are emerging
nationally, and we will review this topic ahead of the draft plan.
National planning policy requires us to protect and enhance sites of biodiversity and
geodiversity importance, with the level of protection being appropriate to its international,
national or local significance. We have a range of important biodiversity and geodiversity
sites within Greater Cambridge, most being of local significance. This policy approach sets
out that development adversely impacting on our biodiversity and geodiversity sites is in
principle not supported. Where in exceptional cases development impacting on such sites
is justified for the public benefits it could bring, the policy will set out how impacts will be
assessed, how protection will be measured and enhancements secured.
Designated biodiversity sites within and close to Greater Cambridge are being impacted
by increasing numbers of visitors – an issue that needs to be addressed to protect these
vulnerable habitats and the species they support. For nationally designated sites, Natural
England have identified Impact Recreation Zones and recommend the application of Suitable
Alternative Natural Greenspace standards to inform the quantity of green space provision
required for people, to lessen the impacts on these nature sites. Greater Cambridge has
relatively few nationally designated nature sites, but many locally designated sites. Ahead
of the draft plan we will explore how we can best measure and mitigate the impact of
development on these local sites.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback to the First Conversation consultation regarding biodiversity and geodiversity
included support for the protection of existing nature sites, and very strong support for
biodiversity net gain including use of off-site contributions. A large number of responses
also suggested that the plan should identify and support a nature recovery network for
Greater Cambridge, to help address the biodiversity emergency at a more strategic level.
A number of comments highlighted the importance for biodiversity of tackling decreasing
water resources and the associated pressure on the natural environment, with suggestions
for solutions including through strategic projects and on a smaller scale, via different design
requirements for new development.

What alternatives did we consider?
1. Rely on emerging national legislation, likely to state a 10% mandatory biodiversity net gain
- This alternative is not the preferred approach, as it would not bring such great benefits for
biodiversity.
2. Require biodiversity net gain higher than 20% - This alternative is not the preferred
approach as it would be likely in most instances to require significant off-site measures,
whereas the national approach to net gain prioritises on-site measures. Requiring high net
gain might also negatively affect development viability.
3. Rely on national policy for protection of sites of biodiversity importance - This alternative
is not the preferred approach as we consider that additional clarity is required to set out how
the principles set out in national policy should be applied at a local level.

Policy BG/GI: Green infrastructure
Figure 54: Map of proposed strategic green infrastructure initiatives
What will this policy do?
This policy identifies the existing green infrastructure network and the strategic initiatives
intended to enhance it and addresses how development proposals should relate to green
infrastructure. Green infrastructure is the network of green spaces and routes, landscapes,
biodiversity, water bodies and heritage, which provide a range of benefits for people, wildlife
and the planet.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require all development proposals – appropriate to its type, scale and location
- to include green infrastructure, providing the following varied benefits for people, wildlife
and planet:
■  Reinforcing and enhancing landscape and townscape, ensuring that proposed green
   infrastructure is appropriate to its local context.
■  Supporting delivery of biodiversity net gain, including by providing links between habitats

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
   within and beyond the site boundary, and connecting where appropriate to the wider
   ecological network (see below), whilst carefully balancing the needs of wildlife and
   people.
■  Promoting healthy living for all members of the community by providing spaces designed
   to be physically accessible and socially inclusive.
■  Protecting and enhancing the water environment.
■  Enhancing access and connectivity.
■  Providing environmental enhancement.
■  Supporting climate mitigation and adaptation.
To support successful delivery of green infrastructure, the policy will require proposals to
demonstrate that green infrastructure has been planned:
■  As an integral part of the development, so that it informs the overall development design.
   This should include identifying, retaining and enhancing existing natural features of
   value.
■  Across all phases of development.
■  To be successful for the lifetime of the development, including providing plans for
   management, maintenance and funding.
Beyond setting out green infrastructure design principles as above, we are exploring whether
this policy should require development to meet a green infrastructure standard such as
Building with Nature. We would welcome your views on this topic, and will confirm the
preferred approach at draft plan stage.
The policy will also require development proposals to protect and enhance the wider green
infrastructure network as follows:
■  Require all new development to protect the existing green infrastructure assets, which
   will be identified on the policies map which will accompany the Local Plan.
■  Our Green Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping has identified a number of strategic green
   infrastructure initiatives which have the potential to enhance the existing network. This
   policy will require all new development to help deliver or contribute to support delivery
   of the green infrastructure strategic initiative objectives. Contributions will include the
   establishment, enhancement and the on-going management costs.
The list of strategic green infrastructure initiatives includes the following:
1: Revitalising the chalk stream network
2: River Cam Corridor
                                                                                      173

You can find further information on the purpose and objectives of each of these schemes in
the Greater Cambridge Green Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping Final Report (2021).
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy sets out that Local Plans should take a strategic approach to
maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats - for wildlife - and green infrastructure – for
people, recognising the wide range of benefits that such green spaces can provide.
This policy will require all development proposals to include green infrastructure to provide
a range of benefits appropriate to its type, scale and location. Additional green infrastructure
design principles are included in other policies in this Plan. Further to green infrastructure
design principles, the policy identifies a number of principles relating to the planning process
to ensure the successful delivery of green infrastructure.
Drawing on extensive engagement with partners and local groups, our Green infrastructure
Opportunity Mapping Baseline Report identified the existing Greater Cambridge green
infrastructure network – including nature conservation sites, and also other green spaces
such as green spaces designated for heritage, Public Rights of Way and water spaces - and
the opportunities and challenges the network faces.
Drawing together these opportunities, challenges, and existing and proposed projects in the

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
area, including responses to the Call for Green Space sites, the Greater Cambridge Green
Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping Final Report (2021) identifies fourteen area-specific and
dispersed long term priority enhancements to this network – described as strategic initiatives
- helping to provide the wide-ranging benefits that green infrastructure brings as noted
above. Examples of initiatives supporting the councils’ doubling nature ambitions include
the enhancement of the Fens to the east of Cambridge and additional woodland planting in
the Western Gateway close to Cambourne, while other initiatives are focused on providing
green space for people to enjoy thereby relieving pressure on our nature sites, such as the
proposed ‘Green Lung’ for North Cambridge, located between Northstowe, Waterbeach and
the edge of Cambridge.
In developing these ideas we’ve talked with partners including Natural Cambridgeshire, the
Wildlife Trust and Natural England, to ensure our initiatives complement and support existing
projects such as Natural Cambridgeshire’s landscape scale green infrastructure areas,
and the Cambridge Nature Network Priority Areas. The emerging Environment Bill requires
the identification of Nature Recovery Networks at a regional level – an aim reflected in our
Oxford-Cambridge Arc Environmental Principles - our nature-focused green infrastructure
initiatives inform our view of our priority local ecological network as local components of this
wider Network.
As our green infrastructure evidence sets out, delivering these initiatives will take time.
There may be a range of projects that will help deliver each initiative, with different projects
potentially being led by different organisations. Significant partnership working will be
required to achieve each initiative; they will also require funding from a range of sources.
Explicitly identifying these initiatives and their objectives in the Local Plan will not restrict
development in the broad areas they cover. Instead, it will enable us to ensure that the
design of development within these priority initiative areas contribute to delivering the
initiatives’ long-term priorities.
Contributions secured for off-site net gain will allow us to invest in these projects. Open
space contributions where space is not delivered on site could also be used. As set out in
BG/EO we are still developing these standards, and they will be consulted on at the draft
plan stage.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback to the First Conversation consultation relevant to green infrastructure included
stating that the Plan should protect existing green spaces and ensure that green space
is provided on site. A number of responses stated that we should plan strategically for a
green space network, connecting existing green spaces including opportunities crossing the
boundary of Greater Cambridge. Comments highlighted that the Plan should help improve
access to green space, including by providing significant new green spaces close to where
                                                                                       175

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
people live, but also noted the importance of balancing public access with the need for
undisturbed natural habitats.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as national planning policy requires
plans to address Green Infrastructure.
2. Identify the green infrastructure strategic initiatives in a supplementary planning document
rather than in the plan itself - This alternative is not the preferred approach, as it would not
provide such strong support for the initiatives.
3. Restrict development within respective green infrastructure strategic initiative areas - Not
considered a reasonable alternative as the strategic initiatives include very broad areas
within which it would not be appropriate to restrict development.
4. Include an urban greening factor in the policy - This alternative is not the preferred
approach, as we think that measurement of Biodiversity Net Gain and Urban Greening via
a metric-based assessment systems would be likely to overlap, making it overly complex to
run two of these concurrently. The Plan does though require urban greening measures (see
BG/TC, CC/DC and CC/FM).

Policy BG/TC: Improving tree canopy cover
and the tree population
What will this policy do?
This policy will control how development impacts tree canopy cover, the tree population, and
protected trees and hedgerows.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require development proposals to:
■   Preserve, protect and increase the amount and distribution of tree canopy cover.
■   Protect and enhance the tree population on site, including its diversity and distribution.
■   Protect existing trees of value (including landscape, heritage, cultural, amenity,
    biodiversity, ecosystem service or aesthetic value) as measured by a recognised tool
    such as iTree.
■   Protect existing hedgerows and the surrounding land that supports them, and to require
    the planting of new ones where appropriate.
■   Provide sufficient space above and below ground for trees and other vegetation to
    mature.
■   Provide appropriate replacement tree or hedgerow planting, where felling is proved
    necessary.
The policy will also encourage the provision of new woodland of locally appropriate species
in appropriate locations.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy and guidance recognises the many benefits provided by trees,
including encouraging walking and enhanced physical and mental health; contributing to
local environmental character and distinctiveness; providing habitats for wildlife; supporting
sustainable drainage; mitigating climate change by storing carbon dioxide; and reducing
noise and excessive heat in urban areas. Further to this, proposed changes to the National
Planning Policy Framework will see authorities required to make new streets tree-lined.
Government has also recently launched the England Trees Action Plan 2021-24. At an
Oxford-Cambridge Arc level we have signed up to the aim of increasing tree and woodland
cover across the Arc from 7.4% to 19%.
Tree canopy cover is the name given to the layer of leaves and branches that cover the
ground. It is measured as a percentage of the total area. Large-canopied tree species
                                                                                      177

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
provide a wider range of benefits because of the larger surface area of their canopy. Which
is why supporting an increase in canopy cover rather than just an increase in the number of
trees is a priority.
The tree population or treescape includes the variety of species, ages and distribution of
trees within an area. The greater the variety and distribution, the greater the biodiversity
value and resilience of the tree population.
Locally, low tree and tree canopy cover is recognised as a weakness within the ecological
network of Greater Cambridge, both in the rural agricultural areas typified by large open
fields lacking boundary features, and in more urban areas which pre-date the current
requirements for ecological enhancement above no net loss. To address these challenges,
the Cambridge City Council Citywide Tree Strategy 2016-26 Canopy Cover Project seeks
to support Cambridge City Council’s aim of achieving 19% tree cover by the 2050s; South
Cambridgeshire also has identified a priority of increasing tree canopy cover in it is Doubling
Nature Strategy.
In response to the above context, this policy seeks to ensure that development proposals
increase tree canopy cover, enhance treescape, and protect existing trees of value. Where
tree retention or planting is proposed in conjunction with new developments, the objective
should be to achieve a harmonious relationship between trees and structures that can be
sustained in the long term. The constraints imposed by trees, both above and below ground
should be considered at the outset as they will inform site layout.
We recognise that in some instances felling of existing trees or hedgerows may be
necessary to meet wider placemaking objectives. In such cases the policy will require
replacement planting.
Hedgerows are also important biodiversity, cultural and archaeological features in South
Cambridgeshire in particular, noting our relative lack of tree canopy cover, and it is important
to retain and protect both hedgerows themselves and the surrounding space which supports
their flourishing (known as terroir).
Groupings of trees in woodland multiply the benefits provided by individual trees. We want to
encourage the provision of additional broad-leaved woodland in appropriate locations, which
could be provided at a range of scales and in different contexts, including for example micro-
woods, tree belts, orchards and woodland.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback to the First Conversation consultation relevant to trees and hedgerows included
comments supporting the protection of existing trees, noting their varied benefits, and also
supporting the planting of new trees and woodlands in appropriate locations. Comments
noted that a strategic approach should be taken to tree and hedgerow provision, noting that

                                                     Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
it is not just about the number of trees. Some comments raised the importance of balancing
the priority for tree planting alongside other priorities such as the need for housing and
employment, and also landscape impacts.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Rely on national policy - This alternative is not the preferred approach as it would not
provide protection for trees of amenity or other value that are not part of ancient woodland or
having Tree Protection Order status.
2. Set a specific requirement for tree canopy cover in new development. - This alternative is
not the preferred approach as high canopy cover requirements could mean that woodland
would dominate a development site’s landscape and biodiversity provision, at the expense of
a more biodiverse mix of habitats and landscapes.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy BG/RC: River corridors
What will this policy do?
This policy will control development that has an impact on river corridors of the River Cam
and its tributaries in Greater Cambridge.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require development located along the River Cam and its tributaries to:
■  Protect, enhance and restore natural features, including:
   ■   Support the renaturalisation of the rivers themselves – supporting the aims of the
       Cambridge Chalk Streams project.
   ■   Restore natural floodplains and integration of green infrastructure to protect
       communities at risk of flooding.
   ■   Establish riparian habitats where appropriate.
■  Protect and enhance the existing landscape of river corridors, referring to the Greater
   Cambridge Landscape Character Assessment for guidance.
■  Ensure that the location, scale and design of development, protects and enhances
   the character, visual amenity and historic significance of river corridors and connected
   locations, including in particular considering views to and from rivers.
■  Support enhanced access to, from and along river corridors for walking and cycling,
   whilst balancing this with the need to protect and enhance habitats for biodiversity,
   including:
   ■   For the river Cam, supporting the delivery of a continuous Cam Valley Trail.
   ■   Enhancing connections between the rivers and other green spaces.
   ■   Providing improved wayfinding and interpretation resources.
■  Support tourism and recreation associated with river corridors, in appropriate locations,
   whilst ensuring that this does not impact negatively on our rivers’ other roles.
Why is this policy needed?
Our rivers, and in particular the River Cam and its tributaries, provide a variety of critical
roles in Greater Cambridge. The Greater Cambridge Green Infrastructure Opportunity
Mapping Final Report and Greater Cambridge Landscape Character Assessment identify
key features to protect and opportunities for enhancement of river corridors. The policy will
seek to address the following key roles, challenges and opportunities for our river corridors:
■  Supporting habitats: The River Cam is designated as a county wildlife site in recognition
   of the river’s importance in linking semi-natural habitats, including ecologically-
   designated sites such as Stourbridge Common Local Nature Reserve and Sheep’s

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
   Green and Coe Fen Local Nature Reserve, with the wider countryside of South
   Cambridgeshire. The Integrated Water Management Study notes the critical impact of
   water abstraction on the health of the chalk streams. The Greater Cambridge Green
   Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping Final Report identifies revitalising the chalk streams
   network as a priority strategic green infrastructure initiative, with a focus on restoring the
   chalk streams’ natural shape, form and flow, alongside the critical need to reduce the
   impact of our water abstraction on the chalk streams (see CC/WE).
■  Water storage: Our rivers are a source of flood risk. Restoration of natural flood plains
   where practicable and provision of green infrastructure can help reduce flood risk along
   the rivers itself and beyond. Wet woodland will self-set and grow where conditions
   are right and management allows. Providing the right conditions for trees to grow in
   appropriate locations in river corridors can support flood risk mitigation and biodiversity.
■  A defining role in our landscape, heritage and townscape: The Greater Cambridge
   Landscape Character Assessment identifies the key landscape features of the Cam
   and other river corridors in Greater Cambridge, and sets out guidance for integrating
   development into the landscape. Development proposals should consider this guidance
   to inform its response to this policy.
■  Supporting leisure and recreation: the river Cam in particular provides leisure access
   for walking and cycling. The Green Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping Final Report
   identifies an opportunity to enhance this role to create a continuous Cam Valley Trail, and
   also to enhance connections between the river and other green spaces in and around
   Cambridge.
■  Supporting tourism: The River Cam is an international tourist attraction, drawing many
   visitors each year, including for punting and travelling further afield by boat. We want
   to continue to support this role, but this needs to ensure that it does not harm the other
   roles noted above.
Recognising the varied role that the River Cam corridor plays, the Greater Cambridge
Green Infrastructure Opportunity Mapping Final Report identifies the Cam Valley (split into
three parts including north of the city, within the city, and south of the city) as a strategic
opportunity for enhancement of Greater Cambridge’s green infrastructure network.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was no specific question in the First Conversation relating to rivers and river corridors.
However, a number of responses to the consultation highlighted the importance of protecting
and enhancing rivers and streams from damaging activity, and in particular protecting the
River Cam tributaries from over abstraction and enabling them to adapt to climate change. A

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
Not to have a specific river corridors policy, relying instead on overarching green
infrastructure and landscape polices - This alternative is not the preferred approach
because of the need to ensure that the important cross-cutting role that our river corridors
play in relation to biodiversity, landscape, heritage, recreation and tourism is protected and
enhanced.

Policy BG/PO: Protecting open spaces
What will this policy do?
This policy will address how important open spaces are considered in the planning process.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will continue to include policies which identify and protect open spaces,
including village greens, parks, sports and recreation areas, allotments, community orchards
and Protected Village Amenity Areas, and Local Green Space.
Why is this policy needed?
Our settlements contain a wide variety of open spaces, that make significant contributions to
the character of places, but also provide important local amenities. It is important that these
are protected from development that could have an adverse impact on these qualities. The
type of projection will vary according to the type of space, and policy criteria will be needed
for each, as is the case in the adopted 2018 Local Plans.
It will also need to continue to recognise that in some cases development on open space
may be appropriate if it has limited qualities and would lead to overall quality or quantity
improvements.
Access to a range of open spaces for different activities, for all ages is an essential part of
sustaining healthy communities, supporting the local environment, and encouraging social
interaction with local people. We are developing evidence on open spaces, and this will
accompany the draft plan.
Local Green Space is a designation which applies a Green Belt style of protection. A number
of these were identified in the last South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 and will be
carried forward into the new plan. They are required to be demonstrably special to a local
community and hold a particular local significance. Reflecting this, the neighbourhood plan
process would be particularly suited to demonstrating this local value and identifying new
spaces if communities wish to identify further spaces.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback from the First Conversation consultation included that we should ensure everyone
has access to green space. Residents should have access to areas for growing food, caring
for the natural environment, green open spaces and small woodlands. We should identify
important ecological areas in the Local Plan which can be augmented and connected,
and which should be avoided by new development. We should provide accessible and all-
                                                                                      183

weather exercise areas for all ages in green spaces.
What alternatives did we consider?
■   No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as this would not plan positively
    for the provision of open space, which is required by national planning policy and would
    damage the character and quality of life in settlements.

Policy BG/EO: Providing and enhancing open
spaces
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how new development should provide new and enhanced open space
to meet the needs it generates.
Proposed policy direction
Open space and recreation provision will be required to be provided by new development,
appropriate to the scale and location of the development. Provision will be onsite where
appropriate, if not, financial contributions will be sought to help improve off site facilitates.
This includes space for sports pitches, play space for children and teenagers, and more
informal spaces, such as for dog walking. Allotments and other community food growing
opportunities such as community orchards will also be sought. It is also important that green
spaces are multi-functional where possible.
The type of provision sought will be guided by the needs and opportunities of the local area.
This will vary across Greater Cambridge, requiring tailored solutions to individual locations.
The Councils have adopted open space standards, set out in their adopted 2018 Local
Plans. These establish the quantity and accessibility of open space that should be provided,
when it should be on site or is used to guide the scale of financial contribution required for
off-site provision, guided by local opportunities and constraints.
These standards are different for Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire, reflecting the
differences between the City with its urban character and formal parks for example, and the
more rural environment of the villages. A review of the standards will be carried out to inform
the draft plan to ensure they are up to date.
Why is this policy needed?
Open spaces, regardless of ownership, are a key aspect of high-quality urban and rural
environments and are often fundamental to the character of an area. Attractive, accessible
and well-designed open space can support and enhance the appearance of an area,
creating more desirable places to live and underpin good growth. Open spaces and
recreation facilities provide people with a place to relax and socialise as well as encouraging
healthier lifestyles by providing opportunities for sport, informal play and daily encounters
with the natural environment. They can also offer people the opportunity to grow their own
food in allotments and community gardens and orchards.
                                                                                      185

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Multifunctional spaces can help people to socialise and relax as well as encourage healthier
lifestyles. These areas can also assist with climate change strategies by reducing local heat
islands in urban areas. The policy will support the delivery of large-scale green spaces which
may also include water spaces, in order to provide a range of benefits in one location such
as providing recreation space, providing habitats for wildlife, reducing heat island effects and
reducing flood risk.
An essential part of the character of Cambridge stems from its many green spaces, trees
and other landscape features, including the River Cam. These not only play an important
role in promoting both active and passive sport and recreational activities but also provide
valuable amenity space and support for biodiversity.
In both new and rural settlements, open spaces help form the individual character and
identity of a village as well as encourage social interaction and recreational activity. These
spaces can therefore play an important role in helping communities develop greater social
cohesion and avoid feelings of social isolation leading to greater community resilience.
Open spaces not only help support the health, social and cultural well-being of local
communities but also help support strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate
change.
The varied nature of the area means that tailored solutions will be required. In Cambridge,
urban areas may require investment in existing sites, such as improvements to the quality
of sports pitches, and innovative approaches to new facilities such as creating safe jogging
routes, or using roof space. In the villages open space is often focused around a recreation
ground. These are typically owned and managed by Parish Councils, and they will play an
important role in understanding the constraints and opportunities for enhancement. New
communities and major developments offer the opportunity for a bespoke approach, and will
be expected to include a range of accessible open spaces and facilities.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Some of the key feedback received during the First Conversation consultation included
views that development should contribute to open space and green infrastructure in and
beyond development sites. We should create public spaces for social interaction, that are
accessible and safe for people of all ages and abilities, and well connected by walking and
cycling routes. Our plans should promote healthy lifestyles, including access to areas for
growing food and caring for the natural environment. We should promote outdoor activities,
including by creating all-weather exercise areas. We should also consider access to more
natural areas, including separate areas which specifically support wildlife.

3.3       Wellbeing and social inclusion
In response to the First Conversation consultation on how the plan could achieve ‘good
growth’ you told us that we should be locating development in sustainable locations. We
should be delivering a range of housing, including affordable, with access to safe and
affordable sustainable transport. We should support communities to thrive and increase their
resilience, providing community and shared spaces, and protecting valuable open spaces.
We should ensure people have access to education and health services. We should make
places inclusive, providing employment and training opportunities, and provide space for
cultural activities and for social enterprise. We should also help people live healthy lives,
such as providing opportunities to grow local food.
Aim for our wellbeing and social inclusion policies:
Help people in Greater Cambridge to lead healthier and happier lives, ensuring that
everyone benefits from the development of new homes and jobs.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy WS/HD: Creating healthy new
developments
What will this policy do?
This policy will integrate health considerations into the planning and design of new development.
Proposed policy direction
We will seek to integrate health considerations into policies across the Plan. This would
require health principles to be applied to new developments, drawing on the ten principles
developed from the Healthy New Towns initiative.
Health Impact Assessments will be required to accompany planning applications (at a level
of detail appropriate to the scale and nature of the application) with an updated approach to
reflect good practice.
We also propose to explore a policy which restricts the development of new hot-food
takeaway premises close to schools or leisure centres and limits the concentration of hot
food takeaway premises in city, town, neighbourhood and village centres.
Why is this policy needed?
Place and space have a significant impact on health and wellbeing. The ability of individuals
to lead healthy lifestyles is deeply influenced by the environment in which they live.
Cambridge City Council identifies improving health outcomes for people on low incomes
as an element in addressing poverty and inequality in the City (Cambridge Anti-Poverty
Strategy 2020-2023).
Good physical and mental health is related to good quality housing and developments, well
designed street scenes, well laid out neighbourhoods, quality and efficiency in transport
systems, opportunities to experience community, leisure and cultural services activities and
access to green and open space.
Following on from lessons learnt at Cambourne and Orchard Park, Northstowe, a developing
new town in South Cambridgeshire, became a demonstrator site in NHS England’s Healthy
New Towns (HNT) programme. Ten principles for creating healthy places were developed
from the lessons learnt from all of the demonstrator sites in the programme:
  1.  Plan ahead collectively
  2.  Assess local health and care needs and assets
  3.  Connect, Involve and empower local people and communities
  4.  Create compact neighbourhoods
  5.  Maximise active travel

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
  6.   Inspire and enable healthy eating
  7.   Foster health in homes and buildings
  8.   Enable healthy play and leisure
  9.   Develop health services that help people stay well
  10.  Create integrated health and well-being centres.
Each principle includes a range of actions that Councils and other key players in new
developments can implement in order to create a healthy new place. Applying the principles
will help to address the health and wellbeing of all new residents however it also creates an
opportunity to address some of the health inequalities that are displayed locally.
Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a method of considering the positive and negative
impacts of development on the health of different groups in the population, in order to
enhance the benefits and minimise any risks to health.
The HIA includes specifically a consideration of the differential impacts on different groups in
the population, because certain groups are potentially more vulnerable to negative impacts
from development such as those on a low income, people involved in the criminal justice
system, minority ethnic groups, young, disabled (physically and learning) and older people.
The current South Cambridgeshire Local Plan (September 2018) included a requirement
for HIAs to be submitted with planning applications subject to the size of the development. It
is proposed to extend this policy across Greater Cambridge at a level of detail appropriate to
the scale and nature of an application.
An area of concern in both Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire is the growth in obesity of
local residents particularly in childhood. The 2018/19 Joint Strategic Needs Assessment
District Summary (JSNA) (Cambridgeshire Insights) indicates that South Cambridgeshire
has significantly lower levels of excess weight in children and adults, nevertheless, almost
25% of local children leaving primary school are overweight or obese. In Cambridge, a
greater proportion of children have excess weight in the most deprived wards in Cambridge.
2017/18 data from Public Health England (PHE) reported in the Cambridge Anti-Poverty
Strategy 2020-2023 shows that in King’s Hedges Ward the proportion is over 35%.
Public Health England in its guidance on Using the Planning System to Promote Healthy
Weight Environments (February 2020) describes how hot food takeaways within easy
walking distance, provide a less healthy but often attractive and affordable food options for
school pupils and could be a contributing factor to poor eating habits in children and counter
healthy eating programmes within schools.
It also reports that studies have found that takeaway food outlets are often located in areas
of higher socioeconomic deprivation. Their data on fast food outlets by local authority found
that there is a strong association between deprivation and the density of fast food outlets,
with more deprived areas having more fast food outlets per 100,000 population. If we take
                                                                                       191
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
this approach forward, we will need to identify which facilities it should apply to (for example
which schools) an appropriate distance (400m has typically been applied in other areas), and
what is considered to be an over concentration, based on local circumstances. The details
will then be included in the draft Local Plan for consultation.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation, when we asked you how you think new developments
should support healthy lifestyles, you raised a wide variety of issues such as the quantity,
quality, affordability, accessibility and sustainability of housing, air quality, noise pollution,
broadband availability, the need for formal and informal public social spaces, playgrounds
and skateparks, sports facilities, swimming pools, allotments and communal gardens; and
the importance of providing faith, health and community centres.
When asked about supporting healthy lifestyles, you also asked for a variety of green
spaces. The need for low carbon development was also highlighted. There was support for
sustainable travel from cycling and walking to public transport, and that some developments
should be car free. You asked that we consider safety and accessibility by all ages and all
abilities. You said employment, facilities and spaces need to be located close to or within
places where people live. We should support healthy eating by reducing the number of fast
food takeaways and promoting healthy, organic, eating. You wanted communities to be
actively engaged both in organisation and participation of activities and inequalities between
residents to be addressed.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative, as the health of communities is a
fundamental issue planning must consider, and an important theme in the feedback we received.

Policy WS/CF: Community, sports, and
leisure facilities
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out what new community (including culture, education and healthcare),
sports, and leisure facilities should be provided and sustained through new development.
Open space is addressed separately by BG/EO.
Education in this policy relates to early years, primary, secondary and further education
provision for all children and young people, including those with special educational needs
and/or disabled people, where residential elements may form part of the provision.
Proposed policy direction
This policy will support the development of new facilities in appropriate locations where
there is a local need for the facilities, and they are in close proximity to the people they will
serve. They will also need to take account of what already exists in the area and should not
undermine their long-term viability. New or replacement major facilities serving the city, or
where appropriate the sub region, would need to follow the sequential approach to main
town centre uses established by national planning policy, and be located in sustainable,
accessible locations. Existing facilities and services will continue to be protected, where the
loss would cause an unacceptable reduction in the quality, capacity or access in the locality.
The loss of facilities will only be supported if they are either suitably replaced or it can be
satisfactorily proven they are no longer needed.
The Local Plan will require appropriate community, cultural, education, sports and leisure
provision to meet the needs generated by new developments. The scale and range of this
provision or contribution will need to address a wide variety of needs, maximising access for
all ages and abilities. These also need to reflect changing approaches to service delivery, for
example with community hubs where a variety of different complementary services can be
grouped together efficiently.
In large scale developments and new communities, community development strategies will
be required, to explore how places will become communities, and how early residents will
be supported. These strategies may include cultural and public art activities, to help bring
together new communities at an early stage of their development and should help foster
greater community interaction and place making. It is also important that social infrastructure,
provided to support new residential developments is provided in both appropriate locations
and a timely manner.
                                                                                       193

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
Community, cultural, education, sports and leisure services and facilities play an important
role in making places vibrant, healthy and sustainable. These are important in both new and
established settlements.
The provision of community and cultural facilities play a key role in the both the development
and day-to-day life of local communities. They allow a broad range of local activities to be
organised and hosted, encouraging greater social interaction between people including with
those who might otherwise not talk to each other. These activities bring people together and
create much more cohesive and resilient communities.
Easy access to good quality educational provision is important for supporting economic
growth, developing strong sustainable communities, promoting economic prosperity and
sustaining quality of life. Similarly, access to sports and leisure facilities/sites is important for
encouraging and supporting people to follow heathy lifestyles as well as developing social
cohesion and interaction. It is therefore important that new and replacement facilities support
new and existing communities, respectively. These should also facilitate the growth of the
area by providing sufficient capacity to accommodate community need and demand.
Policies are needed to ensure these facilities and services are delivered to support new
development. Appropriate care is also needed to ensure new facilities do not undermine
existing facilities. It is also equally important to ensure these are protected from loss to
alternative uses, to support established settlements.
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will be informed by a range of evidence on community
facilities. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan will accompany the plan which will identify what
facilities are needed, and how they will be funded. This will include provision for schools and
health, and be prepared in consultation with service providers. Further details are provided
in I/ID Infrastructure and Delivery in the Infrastructure theme. We will also be updating our
evidence on specific issues related to community facilities, sport, and indoor facilities, and
these will be available at the next stage of plan making.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Some of the key feedback received during the First Conversation consultation included
that the plan should require a range of facilities to be available. The timing was important,
as people’s needs should be met when they move into new developments. We should also
consider where they are placed, as they should be easily accessible by walking and cycling.
A wide range of types of facilities were referenced, including community rooms, meeting
places, communal workspaces, through to art galleries and venues. Sport facilities were also
important, including swimming pools. The importance of these spaces for social interaction
was important, highlighted by the isolation impacts of COVID-19. In terms of their delivery,

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
we should involve communities at the planning stages, and consider longer term issues of
governance and maintenance.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, relying on national guidance – Not considered a reasonable alternative due to the
need to respond to local issues and provide satisfactory provision to support development in
a sustainable form.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy WS/MU: Meanwhile uses during long
term redevelopments
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out when and how meanwhile uses should be provided before and during
development of major sites.
Proposed policy direction
This policy will seek meanwhile uses on vacant sites or in underused buildings as part of the
phased development of major development sites and within other vacant sites and premises
where a longer-term use is still being resolved. These meanwhile uses will support the local
community and contribute to the vibrancy of the area as new communities develop.
Why is this policy needed?
A meanwhile use can be described as a situation where a site or building is used for a
duration of time before it is turned into a more permanent end state, taking advantage of a
short window of opportunity. Examples of meanwhile uses include pop-up shops and cafes,
creative workspace and exhibitions, short-term office units, temporary community meeting
places and facilities and temporary housing.
Some strategic developments can take years to complete. Providing temporary spaces,
buildings and uses during the initial stages of the development can help provide
opportunities for active uses throughout the redevelopment helping to develop a sense of
community early on and helping the community to avoid ‘new towns blues’.
Meanwhile use can also provide temporary uses in vacant and underused buildings while the
longer use of these sites is still being resolved. For example, the use of vacant high street
units for pop-up shops or cultural or creative uses can help to retain vitality and vibrancy in
shopping areas while a longer-term use is being sought.
Meanwhile spaces can support early-stage businesses and local businesses requiring
affordable space, such as those in the creative sector, to take the next step in the
development of their businesses. They can also provide a pipeline of businesses that could
then locate to permanent spaces within the development.
As a recent example locally, it is currently proposed to retain some of the existing buildings
at the Waterbeach Barrack site for temporary uses while other parts of the development at
Waterbeach New Town are being built out.
If we take this approach forward, we will need to consider how we encourage meanwhile

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
uses on major sites and other vacant sites and premises across the area. We could, for
example, seek simply to encourage them or, require feasibility studies and, if feasible,
meanwhile strategies to be submitted for phased major developments.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Some of the key feedback received during the First Conversation consultation included:
■   Ensure that infrastructure, services and facilities are delivered as part of new
    developments and that temporary or smaller infrastructure should be provided to ensure
    there is infrastructure in place on occupation.
■   Provide spaces for the community as part of new developments.
■   It is important to build in community meeting places where people who might not
    normally have an opportunity to meet each other can do.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy – This alternative is not the preferred approach due to the need to help to
develop a sense of community early on in major new developments to help to avoid ‘new
town blues’, and the opportunities that meanwhile uses on other sites could provide.
2. Having a policy which only relates to phased development on major sites - This alternative
is not the preferred approach as it would not take advantage of the opportunities provided by
vacant sites.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy WS/IO: Creating inclusive employment
and business opportunities through new
developments
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how new developments should support the skills and training needs of
local residents and provide opportunities for local businesses.
Proposed policy direction
It is proposed to require appropriately scaled developments to contribute to local training,
skills and employment opportunities, for example apprenticeships, to help to ensure that the
local community benefits from the development.
In addition, appropriately scaled developments would be required to provide access for local
businesses to supply chain opportunities in various stages of development.
If we take this approach forward, we will need to define the threshold for appropriately scaled
development which we will do at the draft plan stage.
Why is this policy needed?
The Cambridge Anti-Poverty Strategy 2020-2023 identifies that while a number of the
indicators have improved since 2014, poverty remains a significant issue in Cambridge. The
Strategy identifies a “hollowed out labour market” as a particular issue in the City where, due
to the strength of the higher education, hi-tech and bio-tech sectors, the majority of jobs are
in higher-skilled occupations. It states that this may limit the opportunities for people on low
incomes to secure higher-paid occupations requiring intermediate level qualifications and skills.
South Cambridgeshire does not have the same level of inequalities as Cambridge. However,
like rural areas across the country there will be pockets of deprivation that do not show up
in deprivation indices because the nature of deprivation in rural areas is different to that in
urban areas and because of the dispersed nature of rural deprivation.
Skills and Training in the Construction Industry 2018 prepared by BMG Research Ltd
from a commission by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) (2019) reports the
results of a survey of over 1,300 businesses in the UK. Nearly half of employers that had
tried to recruit skilled staff had experienced difficulties in filling the positions (47%). The most
frequently cited cause of hard-to-fill vacancies was that applicants lack the skills required
(73%), while not enough young people being trained in the construction industry was also a
significant cause (64%).

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
New developments can provide an opportunity to spread the benefits of development and
address financial exclusion by providing opportunities to maximise skills development and
employment opportunities for local people through, for example, on-site apprenticeships
and work experience. Given the scale of development planned in Greater Cambridge over
the coming years, the policy will also help to provide a pool of skilled labour that will support
development and reduce the need to bring in skills and labour.
Some examples of these types of requirements elsewhere are provided below.
In Reading, contributions during the construction phase, in the form of either the
implementation of an agreed Employment and Skills Plan or a financial contribution, are
required from commercial and other uses of gross internal floor area of 1000m2/ 1ha or more
and for residential developments of 10 units/ 0.5ha or more. End user phase contributions
are required from all commercial/ employment generating uses of gross internal floor area of
1000m2 or more.
In Eastbourne, thresholds include all developments, including change of use, that create/
relate to 1,000m² (gross). This also includes developments of strategic importance (for
example, essential infrastructure, development identified in Council plans and strategy) and
all of those that create 25+ jobs. For major residential developments the threshold is 10 or
more gross units.
In Lancaster all developments of 20 or more residential units and / or 1,000m2 of new
commercial floorspace will be considered for their suitability to undertake an Employment
and Skills Plan. However, there is flexibility in the Employment and Skills Plans -
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), for example, where a development proposal
that exceeds the threshold does not suit the application of Employment and Skills Plans
(for example the developer may already have an appropriate training scheme in place). The
policy also states that the Council would not wish to seek to overburden development in
accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework.
The planning permission for Urban & Civic’s development at Waterbeach includes an
obligation for the developers to submit a Jobs Brokerage Scheme for approval by the local
authority. Initiated by Urban & Civic, the scheme includes how the developers will work
with partners to provide opportunities for local employment, apprenticeships, training and
development including work placements and work experience, and curriculum and careers
activity with local colleges and schools.
Two of the area’s described in more detail in the accompanying topic paper, Reading
and Wandsworth, also require developers to make local businesses aware of tendering
opportunities particularly during the construction phases of a development. This helps to
support local businesses and their employees and the developers by enabling them to
develop a potentially more resilient local supply chain.
                                                                                      199

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Comments to the First Conversation included that the new Local Plan should seek to support
the needs of lower skilled workers in the area. There is a need to encourage more skilled
and semi-skilled blue collar employment.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - This is not the preferred approach as it would not take the opportunities to
respond to the skills issues identified in Greater Cambridge.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy WS/HS: Pollution, health and safety
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how development should take account of sources of pollution.
Proposed policy direction
We propose that this policy will require that development does not lead to, or is subject to
significant adverse effects as a result of noise, vibration, odour, and/or light pollution. It will
detail how land contamination should be considered, to ensure that the land is suitable for
the end use.
Proposals will need to be appropriate for the air quality in the area, but also address their
impacts on air quality (including requiring Air Quality Management strategies to be prepared
where appropriate).
Policies will apply appropriate protection to and from hazardous installations. Planning
applications for the development of hazardous installations/ pipelines and development close
to hazardous sites or pipelines will be referred to the Health and Safety Executive and/or the
Environment Agency.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires plans to prevent new and existing development from
contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by,
unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability.
Planning policies are also required to address air quality, and seek opportunities to
improve air quality or mitigate impacts. As well as considering the impacts of air quality on
developments themselves, air quality management plans are secured to require mitigation
measures to address the impacts of developments. A particular issue will be seeking to
ensure there is no adverse effect on air quality in air quality management areas (AQMA),
which are currently in affect in the city centre and part of the A14.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In the First Conversation we asked you about how we should achieve improvements in air
quality. We received a variety of responses, many of which are addressed elsewhere in this
consultation.
Issues raised included increases in tree planting, sustainable heating and energy generation,
and provision of electric charging points for buses and private cars. You wanted to reduce
                                                                                       201

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
car use though encouraging sustainable transport, for example through the provision of
safe, connected bus routes and cycle infrastructure. Locating homes close to existing
development and employment areas and away from existing low air quality areas were
suggested. There was support for other options to reduce car use including banning
cars in Cambridge, congestion charging, supporting car sharing, reducing car parking in
developments and in the city centre and restricting coaches, deliveries (at certain times) from
the city centre and HGVs from residential areas. You highlighted the importance of digital
infrastructure to enable home working to reduce the need to travel.
You would like us to monitor and set targets in terms of air pollution, potentially using smart
technology, and to make the information available publicly. Low emission zones in Air
Quality Monitoring Areas were specifically suggested as well as extending clean air zones to
residential areas.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as these are key planning issues that
Local Plans need to address and reflect the vision for the plan to create healthy places.

3.4       Great Places
In response to the First Conversation consultation you told us that Greater Cambridge’s
Local Plan should ensure high quality design and make great places that people enjoy, by
enhancing local landscapes and raising climate ambition, while sensitively responding to the
historic environment.
Aim for our Great Places policies
Sustain the unique character of Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire, and complement it
with beautiful and distinctive development, creating a place where people want to live, work
and play.

Maintaining and creating great places is crucial to sustaining the quality of the area for
people who live, work, study in, and visit Greater Cambridge. Great places are valued
and distinctive, accessible to all people and well-integrated with nature. Valuing place in
this Local Plan aims to ensure that all residents’ quality of life in Greater Cambridge’s can
be improved while enhancing the global excellence of its knowledge economy and the
                                                                                        203

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
preservation of the area’s heritage assets. A place-centred approach can help meet the
diverse needs of different communities to enable Greater Cambridge to retain and attract
global talent and ensure that new development responds to local needs.
The Local Plan covers an area that is both urban and rural, and the proposed spatial
strategy aims to support the individuality and distinctive qualities of Cambridge and the
surrounding villages both large and small. Across each policy area proposed, the plan sets
a priority for delivering high quality and well-designed places to enable new development
that responds positively to the existing context and contributes to creating and maintaining
high quality design of the natural and built environments that combine to form great places.
Design quality that responds to community and climate needs, establishes new connections,
preserves and enhances Greater Cambridge’s character, heritage and natural assets will
be key in reconciling Greater Cambridge’s planned development and helping to meet the
significant challenges of the climate emergency and growing inequalities.
There are many different aspects that combine to help create the character and
quality of places. Design matters will be informed by physical, social and economic
considerations that together influence the quality of any proposal. Since 2008, the
Councils have been using the Cambridgeshire Quality Charter for Growth to provide a
clear and consistent basis for helping to secure a common expectation for the quality
of our new developments. Themes covering the four ‘C’s’ of Community, Connectivity,
Climate and Character have been used to provide an understanding of what needs to
be considered when creating and assessing high quality design. The overlaps between
the themes are equally important and allow judgements to be made that go beyond pure
‘aesthetic’ considerations. Given the strong track record of delivering high quality design
in the Greater Cambridge area, evidenced through award winning schemes and overall
growth delivery, the themes from the Charter have been used to structure policies in
the Great Places chapter. Such an approach is consistent with the National Planning
Policy Framework, the National Design Guide, and National Model Design Code which
identifies Climate, Character and Community as part of the identified ten characteristics
of well-designed places.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Great places are underpinned by all of the local plan’s themes. A great place is somewhere
that:
■   reduces embodied and operational carbon requirements, and adapts over time to support
    low carbon lifestyles;
■   nurtures biodiversity and the delivery of green spaces to enable nature to flourish;
■   fosters wellbeing and inclusion by ensuring that all developments and public spaces are
    safe and accessible;

■   supports a work life balance by enabling employment to be conveniently located to
    residents;
■   delivers homes to meet all people’s needs and locates them conveniently to services and

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy GP/PP: People and place responsive
design
What will this policy do?
This policy will set a strategic vision for achieving high quality design in Greater Cambridge
for both urban and rural areas. This provides a clarity of expectation around understanding
the context of development proposals – both in terms of impact on the place around them
and the needs of users.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require all applicants to demonstrate how their proposals sustain and
enhance the unique qualities of the Greater Cambridge area and the subtleties in the
different landscape and settlement forms. Greater Cambridge is a place of varied and
subtle character, from the historic core of the Cambridge urban area to emerging business
clusters, the biodiverse fen landscapes to the north and rolling countryside to the south, the
historic villages and new towns. The policy will require all planning applications to include
a comprehensive design and access statement that address this context. Development
proposals will be supported that:
Respond to Greater Cambridge’s communities by:
■   Identifying and responding positively to their context, including existing physical features
    and characteristics of natural, historic, social or local importance.
■   Ensuring that proposals meet the principles of inclusive and healthy design, and in
    particular meet the needs of disabled people, older people and those with young
    children.
■   Be designed to remove the threat or perceived threat of crime and improve community
    safety, especially those with protected characteristics under the Equality Act.
■   Using community engagement to inform design decisions.
Improve Greater Cambridge’s connectivity by:
■   Being well connected to, and integrated with, the immediate locality and wider area
    including existing or planned social, environmental, and transport infrastructure.
Support the climate emergency response by:
■   Being designed to be long lasting and low impact in delivery and maintenance.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Enhance the character of Greater Cambridge by:
■   Having a positive impact on their setting in terms of location on the site, height and
    skyline, scale and form, townscape and landscape impacts and available views, to create
    a legacy of beautiful buildings and spaces in Greater Cambridge
■   Using appropriate local characteristics to inform the siting, massing, scale, form,
    materials and landscape design of new development.
■   Tall building proposals must be of exceptional quality and ensure that the character or
    appearance of Cambridge, as a city of spires and towers emerging above the established
    tree line, is maintained.
Why is this policy needed?
The National Planning Policy Framework, was recently updated to emphasise the
importance of good design, and states that, ‘The creation of high quality, beautiful and
sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development
process should achieve.’ Greater Cambridge has a strong track record of delivering
well designed places with many award-winning schemes in Cambridge and South
Cambridgeshire. Since 2008, the core themes covering Community, Connectivity, Climate
and Character set out in the Cambridgeshire Quality Charter for Growth, have been used to
clearly identify the expected quality of new developments.
Aiming for design excellence is crucial for all types of development, whether building or
open space, regardless of tenure, use or ownership. Innovative, high quality design must
be realised to ensure that new development respects and integrates with existing character,
assets and settings, while also constituting high quality architecture. This is a key factor for
successful placemaking as well as a key challenge.
Changes to national planning policy have recently introduced a National Design Guide
and National Model Design Code. Local planning authorities should prepare area-based
character assessments, local design guides or codes, consistent with these and tailored
to the circumstances of the local area following community involvement to reflect local
character and design preferences. The Councils have a range of design guidance already
in place, ranging from guidance on tall buildings and skyline included in the Cambridge
Local Plan, the South Cambridgeshire District Design guide, to individual village designs
guides. We will be considering how we update our guidance to reflect the new approaches
introduced nationally.
To help meet this challenge, Greater Cambridge is establishing a Place and Design Quality
Panel, formed from reviewing existing Design Review services at both Cambridge City
Council and South Cambridgeshire District Councils, to support its aspirations to raise design
quality across the Local Plan area, and has conducted a site typologies study to understand,
protect, utilise and enhance the valued characteristics of different areas in the plan. These
                                                                                      207

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
should ensure that the key aspects and qualities of the built form and varying contexts
across the Greater Cambridge.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Some of the key feedback received during the First Conversation consultation included:
■   that design is an important theme of the Local Plan;
■   ensuring that development is place specific and climate development;
■   policies should allow imaginative and contemporary design;
■   recognising that the historic environment forms part of Great Places;
■   consider issues like accessibility and connectivity;
■   apply the principles set out in the Cambridgeshire Quality Charter;
■   and that we should not grant planning permission for poorly designed development.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative due to requirement for plans to set out a
clear design vision and provide clarity about design expectations.

Policy GP/LC: Protection and enhancement
of landscape character
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how development should address landscape character and features in
Greater Cambridge.
Proposed policy direction
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will require developments to:
■   Respect, retain or enhance local landscape character (as set out in the Greater
    Cambridge Landscape Character Assessment).
■   Fully consider cumulative effects of development and incremental change on landscape
    character.
■   Retain and enhance landscape features within new developments
■   Protect and enhance the setting of Cambridge, including the green corridors extending into
    the city and along the River Cam corridor, and strengthen or recreate the well-defined and
    vegetated edge of Cambridge, improve visual amenity and enhance biodiversity.
■   Protect and enhance the setting of the villages in South Cambridgeshire and continue to
    protect identified Important Countryside Frontages.
■   Protect important green gaps such as between Longstanton and Northstowe.
Why is this policy needed?
The Greater Cambridge landscape is varied with intimate river valleys, open fens, wooded
claylands and ridges, and rolling chalk hills. Built around the banks of the River Cam,
Cambridge is a distinctive and iconic historic university city.
The Local Plan needs to ensure the varied character of different parts of the area is properly
considered in planning decisions. Developments should respond to the local landscape
character and take opportunities for enhancement.
The new Greater Cambridge Landscape Character Assessment (2021) has looked in
detail at the physical and human/cultural influences that have shaped the evolution and
character of the landscape today. It has identified 33 different Landscape Character Areas
with a distinct local identity and sense of place. Detailed information is provided about
each, including the condition of the landscape, key sensitivities and guidance on landscape
management and integrating development into the landscape.
New development can provide opportunities to enhance the landscape, such as improving
the edges of settlements. The edges of Cambridge and the villages are an important area of
                                                                                      209

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
transition which require sensitive landscaping to protect the setting of the settlements and to
provide a well-defined edge which respects townscape and the countryside beyond.
In many South Cambridgeshire villages there are locations where a strong countryside
character penetrates into the village, or separates two parts of a village. These Important
Countryside Frontages, identified in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018, are part
of village character, and warrant continued protection. Other important green gaps in the
landscape which should be protected and maintained will be identified in the policy.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation highlighted we should require developments to be in
keeping with the landscape, informed by Landscape Character Assessments. We should
include policies which seek to protect sensitive and valued landscapes.
The plan needs to consider the whole landscape associated with historic Cambridge and the
River Cam. It should continue to retain significant green corridors through the urban areas
and linking to an enhanced countryside beyond. Development proposals should consider
their impact on views to and from the Greater Cambridge boundary, and on designated and
undesignated heritage assets.
There is also scope to improve the landscape setting of some of the villages.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as policy guidance is needed to guide
how landscape issues are addressed in planning decisions.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy GP/GB: Protection and enhancement
of the Cambridge Green Belt
What will this policy do?
This policy will set the framework for consideration of development proposals in the
Green Belt.
Proposed policy direction
National planning policy places great importance on Green Belt and sets out specific
requirements for how planning proposals in these areas should be considered. New
development in the Green Belt will only be approved in accordance with Green Belt policy in
the National Planning Policy Framework.
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will include the established local purposes of the
Cambridge Green Belt, which are to:
■   preserve the unique character of Cambridge as a compact, dynamic city with a thriving
    historic centre;
■   maintain and enhance the quality of its setting;
■   prevent communities in the environs of Cambridge from merging into one another and
    with the city.
Enhancement of the Green Belt, such as for recreation and biodiversity, will also be
supported.
Why is this policy needed?
The Cambridge Green Belt plays an important role in maintaining the special qualities of
Cambridge as a historic city and the surrounding area.
Whilst national policy sets of the purposes of Green Belt, the Cambridge Green Belt
has particular purposes, and was established to protect the historic city and its setting.
The ‘Cambridge Green Belt Purposes’, were established by the Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough Structure Plan (2003) and have been carried forward into subsequent Local
Plans, including the most recent 2018 Local Plans. The Green Belt Assessment (2021)
considered that these purposes were still relevant and they were used to assess the
potential harm of new development.
National policy set out in the National Planning Policy Framework will be applied when
considering proposals for development in the Green Belt. This establishes that some

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
forms of development are not inappropriate in the Green Belt, and where development is
inappropriate it should not be approved except in very special circumstances.
National planning policy also requires local planning authorities to plan positively to
enhance their beneficial use, such as looking for opportunities to provide access; to provide
opportunities for outdoor sport and recreation; to retain and enhance landscapes, visual
amenity and biodiversity; or to improve damaged and derelict land. Such opportunities are
being explored, in particular through the Green Infrastructure theme in this consultation.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Much of the feedback received in the First Conversation in relation to the Green Belt was
about whether it should be released for development or not. There was recognition of the
value it provides, providing a setting for the historic city, but also providing open space.
Whilst many expressed strong views that it should be protected, others highlighted the
potential benefits in terms of sustainability of releasing land for development when compared
to other locations. This is considered further in the Strategy section of this consultation.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy– Not considered a reasonable alternative due to the need to provide a clear policy
framework specific to the Cambridge Green Belt.

■  Ensure that buildings are orientated to provide natural surveillance and maximise
   opportunities to create active ground floor uses.
■  Create active edges on to public space by locating appropriate uses, as well as
   entrances and windows of habitable rooms next to the street.
■  Use design to minimise adverse impact on neighbouring buildings and spaces in terms
   of privacy and overlooking, sunlight and daylight, overshadowing and other micro
   climate considerations, artificial lighting, vibration, noise, fumes and odour, and other
   forms of pollution.
■  Introduce mixed uses proposals in a way that can benefit all occupants where
   appropriate, avoiding the mixing of incompatible uses.
Create local connections:
■  Ensure building entrances and exits are convenient, safe and accessible for all users
   throughout the day and night, with lighting and security features successfully integrated
   into the design.
Are climate-positive:
■  Create robust and adaptable building forms that can be successfully adapted and
   reused, extending their lifespan and reducing the carbon impacts of demolition.
■  Successfully integrate functional needs such as refuse, recycling, and bicycle parking
   does not negatively impact on the existing building or the amenity of neighbouring
   properties.

Contribute and respond to local character:
■  Provide a comprehensive design approach that achieves the successful integration of
   buildings, routes and spaces between buildings, topography, townscape and landscape.
■  Create attractive and appropriately-scaled built frontages to positively enhance streets
   and/or public spaces in both urban and rural settings.
■  Use materials and details that are of high quality, that will age well and be easy to
   maintain, and if an extension or alteration, reflect, or successfully contrast with, the
   existing building form, through the use of materials and architectural detailing.
■  Ensure that development proposals successfully integrate functional aspects such as
   waste and recycling, bicycle parking and car parking.
■  Any proposal for a structure that breaks the existing skyline and/or is significantly taller
   than the surrounding built form will need to demonstrate through visual assessment or
   appraisal with supporting accurate visual representations, how the proposals enhance
   the existing landscape and townscape and do not cause unacceptable impact on the
   historic environment. Major schemes should share a native 3-D file for assessment.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy emphasises the need to create a robust policy framework to achieve
high quality design and this is supported through the National Planning Practice Guidance:
Design: process and tools, and the National Design Guide. The Greater Cambridge area has
a strong track record of delivering high quality design in new development and it is important
that this continues. The Greater Cambridge Local Plan should seek to ensure buildings and
places of high quality that can improve wellbeing today and be enduring so that they can be
appreciated by future generations.
High quality design goes beyond a pure aesthetic response and includes more detailed
matters such as functional design and assessment of impacts on setting and amenity. High
quality design makes places that put people first, promote health and wellbeing and are
welcoming, feel safe, are enjoyable and easy to use for everyone.
High quality building design is linked to context, in terms of appropriateness, and to
place making in terms of how the proposed development will be sited. Without imposing
architectural tastes or styles, it is important that a proposed development is considered
in terms of site location, height, scale, form and proportions, along with materials and
detailing. Where proposals constitute a ‘tall building’ because they break the skyline and/or
are significantly taller than the surrounding built form, then further assessment of impact on
setting and contribution to the wider context will be required. It is important that the policy
achieves an approach that is both appropriate to urban and more rural contexts to cover
redevelopment within existing contexts as well as development in emerging or new places
being created in the wider Greater Cambridge area.
                                                                                      215

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Materials to be used for new buildings should be suitable for their purpose and setting.
The durability of materials and how they weather are important factors. All the necessary
environmental services, plant, recycling and refuse storage, bicycle and car parking must be
considered early in the design process and be successfully integrated into the development
to form part of the overall design and not as an afterthought. Such features must be secure
and located conveniently but unobtrusively.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
We received a wide range of views during the First Conversation consultation on measures
needed to achieve high quality development. Comments included that:
■   New developments should support better access requirements.
■   Developments should include accessible facilities.
■   Low carbon lifestyles should be supported.
■   The potential for planting and biodiversity should be maximised.
■   Building standards should be improved.
■   High quality design in new developments should be achieved.
■   Design should recognise climate change by maximising potential for latest methods of
    insulation, on-site water recycling and district heating.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative due to the need to respond to local
design issues.

Policy GP/QP: Establishing high quality
landscape and public realm
What will this policy do?
The policy will set out our requirements for the quality of design of landscape and public
realm proposals.
Proposed policy direction
Developers will be required to demonstrate how their proposals meet the following
expectations:
Enabling local communities:
■   Ensure new and enhanced existing routes are designed inclusively, prioritising a pedestrian
    led movement hierarchy including generous and level footways that avoids street clutter.
■   Include seating, drinking water fountains, shade and shelter, bicycle parking, street
    lighting, signage and public art, designed in a coordinated and needs-led approach which
    does not obstruct the public realm or create street clutter.
■   Parking should not reduce the functionality of open spaces, and if on street should be
    inset in an expanded footway to allow pedestrian movements when not occupied.
Enhance connectivity:
■   Ensure that new and existing public realm seamlessly connects, and that the quality and
    function of existing routes are enhanced.
■   Establish streets and open spaces that are well defined, and which clearly demarcate
    public and private space.
■   Create streets that respond to their levels of use while not allowing vehicular traffic to
    dominate.
Respond to climate:
■   Be landscape led, by retaining and enhancing existing features including trees, natural
    habitats, boundary treatments and historic street furniture and/or surfaces that positively
    contribute to the quality and character of an area.
■   Ensure species are selected that enhance biodiversity through the use of native planting
    and/or species capable of adapting to our changing climate.
■   Integrate surface water management through design to enable pedestrian accessibility
    and planting, retaining existing natural features where possible, do not pave over front
    gardens if this is compromised.
■   Factor microclimate into design proposals and that public spaces receive adequate
    sunlight.
                                                                                      217

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Integrate with local character:
■  Respond to its context and relate to the character and intended function of the spaces
   and surrounding buildings through the use of high quality and well detailed materials that
   are easily maintained.
■  Ensure that the right growing conditions and future management regimes for landscape
   schemes are secured and implemented, and ensure that space for trees and other
   planting is incorporated that is appropriate to the scale of buildings.
■  Provide appropriate types of open space whether in urban or more rural places that link
   into other sequences of existing or new landscape spaces and wider settings.
Why is this policy needed?
Public realm helps to define the character and experience of great places, whether within
Cambridge or one of the surrounding villages, and it is crucial that these positive qualities
are maintained into the future. The importance of creating and protecting high quality streets
and other open spaces, both public and private, is a key part of adapting to climate change
pressures, supporting biodiversity, and promoting active and healthy lifestyles. The spaces
between, around and within buildings, streets, squares, parks and open spaces all play a key
role in supporting public life and fostering social interaction. Greater Cambridge’s landscape
spaces and public realm are key to creating a sense of place and play an important role in
enhancing communities’ quality of life and health and wellbeing and can even play a role in
boosting the local economy.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In the First Conversation you told us that we should make accessible places that were not car
dominated, and that supported moving around by walking and cycling. We should make places
welcoming and safe, and we should incorporate community facilities and open spaces.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy and relying on national guidance – Not considered a reasonable alternative due to
the need to respond to local issues.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy GP/HA: Conservation and
enhancement of heritage assets
What will this policy do?
This policy will control development that involves or affects Greater Cambridge’s historic
buildings or structures and its historic places.
Proposed policy direction
Proposals affecting heritage assets will be considered in accordance with the guidance set
out in the National Planning Policy Framework.
Recognising the important contribution heritage assets of various types make to Cambridge
and South Cambridgeshire, the policy will require that proposals properly consider the
historic environment and make a positive contribution to local character.
Development will be required to demonstrate how it preserves or enhances the significance
of the heritage assets of the Greater Cambridge, their setting and the wider townscape,
including views into, within and out of conservation areas.
The Local Plan will also continue to recognise the importance of local heritage assets (including
buildings of local interest). We will include the criteria for the selection of these assets.
The policy will also require the appropriate treatment of archaeology.
Why is this policy needed?
Greater Cambridge’s historic and natural environments define the character and setting
of the City and rural areas, contributing significantly to quality of life and forming a very
significant part of the backdrop to a successful and growing area. Greater Cambridge has
a varied heritage, from the internationally recognised grandeur of King’s College Chapel to
the vernacular buildings of villages in the varied landscapes on the South Cambridgeshire
countryside. The number of conservation areas is high, as is the number of grade I
and grade II* listed buildings. Within the Cambridge urban area there is an exceptional
concentration of significant collegiate buildings around the arc of the River Cam. Open
spaces such as the fens, commons, greens and The Backs are also key historic and green
features of Greater Cambridge. There are a number of registered parks and gardens of
special historic interest, including estates such as Wimpole, college grounds, and the Botanic
Garden. The policy is needed to ensure the quality of all of this is protected and to ensure
that environmental objectives are attained in the delivery of sustainable development.
To support plan making a Strategic Historic Impact Assessment (SHIA) has been

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
commissioned. This includes a baseline study of the setting of Cambridge, with a focus on
identifying the key aspects of that setting and the character of the City that contribute to its
significance as a historic place. This informed a strategic assessment of the growth strategy
options considered which has informed the proposals in this consultation.
Consideration of heritage issues was an important criteria within the Housing and
Employment Land Availability Assessment where potential sites were tested. It is intended to
carry out a full Heritage Impact Assessment of sites at the Draft Local Plan stage.
Other policy approaches proposed in this consultation will help maintain the significance
of Cambridge as an historic city via protection and enhancement of landscape character
of Cambridge and the River Cam; the approach to tall buildings; and progression of a
Management Plan for the historic core.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation highlighted the importance of the historic environment
in Greater Cambridge, from the historic core of Cambridge through to village Conservation
areas. Development could provide opportunities to enhance the historic environment, but
also that it must be carefully considered to ensure impacts are fully assessed. A strategy for
protecting and enhancing the historic environment should be an important part of the plan.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, and relying on national guidance – Not considered a reasonable alternative due to
the requirements to set out a strategy regarding heritage, and the need to respond to local
issues.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy GP/CC: Adapting heritage assets to
climate change
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how the environmental performance of heritage assets should be
balanced against the need to protect and enhance the character and value of that asset.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will:
■   Require retrofit works to be carried out in accordance with the BSI PAS 2035 framework
    and Historic England guidance for energy improvements to heritage assets.
■   Require proposals to take a ‘whole building’ approach to undertaking works to heritage
    assets to enhance environmental performance;
■   Support proposals which seek to undo the damage caused by previous inappropriate
    interventions (e.g. removal of cement render and replacement with breathable options).
■   Give consideration to measures that will reduce carbon emissions and assist with
    adaptation to our changing climate (for example external shading or property level flood
    protection).
The plan will also direct residents to further guidance on how to approach works to older
homes.
Why is this policy needed?
Our Net Zero Carbon Study 2021 shows that existing buildings account for one third
of all greenhouse gas emissions in Greater Cambridge. While high energy efficiency
standards have been introduced for new homes, we cannot meet our climate targets
without reducing emissions and energy usage in all our homes. Improving energy
efficiency is not only good for the climate, but it will also reduce your running costs, and
increase the lifespan of your building.
Nationally, about 20% of our homes were built before 1919, using traditional timber-frame
or solid wall construction methods and materials. Of this 20%, about 1% of homes in
Cambridge and 3% in South Cambridgeshire are Listed Buildings. Maintaining the buildings
we use is a powerful climate action as it ‘locks in’ the carbon used to build these in the first
place. And while traditional buildings in general need to be part of the big push to improve
residential efficiency across the board, in their own analysis the Committee on Climate
Change have concluded that at least 90% of existing buildings in the UK should have energy

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
efficient retrofits for the UK to meet its zero carbon targets. This recognises that some
buildings simply cannot be adapted to eliminate all emissions. However, there are things
that can be done provided that the correct approach is taken. Policy is therefore needed to
support owners of heritage assets to undertake sensitive works to address the performance
of their buildings, in line with best practice guidance for heritage assets.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation highlighted the need to consider the adaptation of listed
buildings to respond to climate change. We should support retrofitting existing development,
including heritage assets, for better energy efficiency, insulation, boilers and energy. We
should provide guidance for retrofitting heritage assets.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as given the scale of heritage assets in
the area, and the challenge of climate change, a policy is needed.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy GP/PH: Protection of public houses
What will this policy do?
This policy will control development proposals involving the loss of public houses.
Proposed policy direction
Safeguard public houses, only allowing their loss to other uses where they are no longer
needed within the community as a public house or other form of community facility,
demonstrated by evidence of effective marketing and exploration of options to make it viable.
Support diversification of public house uses to help them remain viable, such as the use
of part of a pub for another use that would support its viability while respecting the site’s
prevailing character.
Why is this policy needed?
Public houses are an important part of Greater Cambridge’s communities. They help to
foster social interaction and local community life in both urban and rural areas. They are
often the hub of a neighbourhood, street or village and can provide a focal point for cultural
and recreation activities.
Pubs also have an important part to play in the Greater Cambridge economy, not just for the
direct and indirect jobs they provide in the pub supplies, food and brewing industries, but in
supporting the area’s main industries and quality of life by attracting and providing a meeting
place for students, academics, scientists and entrepreneurs, and in attracting office workers,
shoppers and tourists.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation consultation included support for new public houses to
be provided in all new developments. This was received in response to our question about
how we might achieve ‘good growth’ that promotes wellbeing and social inclusion.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – This is not the preferred approach. The adopted Local Plan policies which protect
public houses have reduced the loss of safeguarded public houses. If there was no future
policy to safeguard these sites/uses, there is significant risk of additional losses.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
3.5       Jobs
In the First Conversation in 2020, you told us about the importance of the Cambridge economy
and its high technology clusters. Many major site proposals were suggested, reflecting
Cambridge’s strengths, but there was also concern about the scale of economic growth in the
area. You highlighted that it was important that the area should have a range of jobs, and that
these should be available close to where people live or can travel to sites without relying on
cars. You also wanted us to support our high streets, and to help them diversify.
Aim for our jobs policies
Encourage a flourishing and mixed economy in Greater Cambridge which includes a wide
range of jobs, while maintaining our area’s global reputation for innovation.

In the Strategy section of this consultation we have explored the needs of the economy,
and how they should be planned for. This includes identifying a range of sites to respond to
the findings of the Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development
Evidence Study (November 2020). This includes supporting the needs of the high
technology clusters that Cambridge is famous for, but also other sectors that are needed for
the local area and to provide a variety of employment opportunities.
In the Jobs theme we set out policies that would be applied when considering planning
applications for development. The proposals seek to support employment development in a

range of locations of a scale and type appropriate to the location. The proposals also seek
to reflect how work is changing, by supporting remote working, and improving facilities on
employment parks. They also explore how we could spread the benefits of development
by including affordable workspace. Our town and village centres remain at the heart of our
communities, but the way we are shopping is changing. We explore policies that can help
them adapt.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Great Places – supports delivery of high quality places, helping to create positive working
environments
Wellbeing and social inclusion - creating healthy communities so people can thrive
Homes – deliver homes for people who work in the area
Infrastructure – providing to services facilities and transport the economy needs to work
efficiently.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy J/NE: New employment development
proposals
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the criteria that will determine whether proposals for employment
development in urban areas, villages, and the countryside are acceptable.
Proposed policy direction
Employment development (classes E(g), B2 and B8) will be supported:
■  In Cambridge at sites set out in the Strategy section of this consultation, and within
   appropriate mixed use areas of major change and opportunity areas. Other employment
   proposals to be considered on their merits where they are of an appropriate scale,
   character and accessible location.
■  Within towns and villages, where it is of an appropriate scale and character to the
   location and scale of settlement. The policy would cover both new premises and the
   expansion of existing premises.
■  Close to but outside settlement boundaries of villages subject to a number of criteria
   (described below).
■  In defined ‘established employment areas in the countryside’ (listed below).
■  In the countryside only where the expansion of existing businesses fulfils a number of
   criteria (described below).
Large scale national and regional warehousing and distribution centres will not be supported
in Greater Cambridge.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires plans to help create the conditions in which businesses can
invest, expand and adapt.
As set out in the Strategy section of this consultation, a range of key employment locations
have been identified to support the Cambridge economy. However, there is a range of small
employment sites scattered all over the City. Proposals for new employment development
will be considered on their merits using the range of other policies that will be included in the
plan.
Sensitive small-scale employment development can help sustain rural economies, and
provide a wider range of employment opportunities for local residents. Providing jobs near
to residents to reduce the need to travel was a key issue that was raised during the First

Conversation consultation and supports a number of the Plan’s other themes including
climate change and social inclusion.
For developments within town and village settlement boundaries, scale and character are
key to ensuring that the overall character of the settlement is maintained. For example, it
would be expected that larger proposals are more likely to be considered favourably in towns
and rural centres.
To support local employment opportunities the Local Plan can provide a degree of flexibility
to the edges of villages. Development in these locations would be permitted (outside the
Green Belt) subject to a number of criteria that include: evidence of the lack of availability of
alternative sites and premises; previous development on the site (or evidence that there are
no alternative suitably developed sites); there is a business case for a viable development;
a named first occupant can be cited; the scale and character of the development are in
keeping with the category and scale of the village and accessibility by cycle and foot.
The proposed approach to settlement boundaries (policy SS/SB) generally restricts uses in
the countryside to those specifically that need to be there in order to restrict unsustainable
forms of development. However, there is also a desire to support the rural economy and local
job opportunities. There are many firms working in the rural areas of South Cambridgeshire
away from settlements, and we want to continue to support them. Whilst in general new
development in the countryside is restricted, there are circumstances (outside the Green
Belt) where the expansion of these firms would be acceptable. The policy would define these
circumstances through a series of criteria that include: evidence of the viability of the existing
business and jobs growth; appropriateness of scale, location and appearance and evidence
that these do not negatively impact on the countryside; the reuse of existing buildings where
possible, a named first occupier and no significant adverse traffic impact.
Recognising that a number of business parks are located in the rural areas of South
Cambridgeshire these key employment sites outside the Green Belt were identified in the
Local Plan 2018 as ‘Established Employment Areas in the Countryside’. It is proposed
to continue this designation for the sites previously identified to support their continued
evolution:
■  Cambourne Business Park, Cambourne;
■  Brookfields Business Estate / Park, Twentypence Road, Cottenham;
■  Land at Hinxton Road, South of Duxford;
■  Granta Park, Great Abington;
■  Cambridge Research Park, Landbeach;
■  Site to North of Cambridge Research Park, Landbeach;
■  Daleshead Foods Ltd, Cambridge Road, Linton;
■  Eternit site, Meldreth;
■  Norman Way Industrial Estate, Over;
                                                                                      229

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
■   Former Spicers site, Sawston;
■   Buckingway Business Park, Swavesey;
■   Convent Drive / Pembroke Avenue site, Waterbeach.
National Planning policy requires local planning authorities to plan positively for the
location, promotion and expansion of clusters or networks of knowledge driven, creative
or high technology industries. The Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic
Development Evidence Study (November 2020) explores the presence of clusters in the
area, including their needs and opportunities, involving consultation with key stakeholders. In
particular, the study highlights the presence of Life Sciences, ICT, Professional Services and
Advanced Manufacturing.
The Strategy theme of this consultation proposes a range of sites and policies which
are particularly suited to supporting the needs of clusters. These include significant
opportunities at:
■   North East Cambridge
■   West Cambridge
■   North West Cambridge
■   Cambridge Biomedical Campus
■   Welcome Trust Genome Campus
■   Granta Park
■   Babraham Research Campus
■   New Towns at Northstowe and Waterbeach.
Cluster related employment is not restricted to these areas, and there are smaller
concentrations, and individual firms both in Cambridge and the rural areas of South
Cambridgeshire. Developments proposed to support clusters which meet the proposed
policy requirements in J/NE would be supported, particularly where they include provision of
a range of suitable units, including for start-ups, SMEs, and incubator units.
A need for additional space for warehousing and distribution (Use Class B8) was identified
in the Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development Evidence Study
(November 2020) and potential sites are proposed to be allocated (see the Strategy section
of this consultation). However, whilst we need to meet the needs for local distribution, as
a central location the area may be desirable to national distributors. Given the very high
land take of this type of use, the local pressures on land supply for a range of uses, and the
Green Belt location, it is proposed that the plan continues to not support large scale regional
and national distribution proposals.

What consultation have we done on this issue?
As part of our First Conversation consultation we asked you about particular employment
locations we should be focusing on, and were there specific locations important for different
types of business or industry.
Sustainability was a key issue in many of the responses with requests that employment
space be located be close to where people live in order to reduce the need to travel and
in locations with good public transport access and active travel opportunities. Specific
examples included locating high densities uses such as larger office premises close to rail
stations and supporting development close to new infrastructure such as new East West Rail
stations.
There was support for dispersing employment across Greater Cambridge including in new
communities, existing (and new) clusters and employment sites, neighbourhood and village
locations and on the edge of Cambridge. Where references were made to specific villages,
they tended to be those with larger populations. There was preference for development on
brownfield rather than greenfield land.
There were a range of specific proposals seeking for the plan to support high technology and
life sciences sectors, in many cases by providing large scale new allocations, particularly
focused on expanding existing locations.
For light industrial, industrial and warehousing and distribution uses close proximity
to major road networks at the edge of villages or in close proximity to services and existing
employment uses was suggested.
The general provision of a range of size of sites was recommended and there were specific
suggestions for neighbourhood and village locations to include smaller flexible and co-
working spaces as well as space on industrial estates and business parks. Within new or the
expansion of existing communities, start-up and incubator space was suggested as well as
a requirement that all new developments have some flexible employment space. There was
also caution that business locations should not adversely impact residential areas in relation
to visual and traffic impacts.
A range of alternative sites and locations were suggested and many of these were submitted
in the call for sites. There were also objections to providing more employment space Greater
Cambridge, and that further development should not be supported.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as this would not provide adequate
policy guidance and would fail to support the economy, including the rural economy.
                                                                                      231

Policy J/RE: Supporting the rural economy
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the approach to re-use and replacement of rural buildings, and
proposals related to land-based enterprises.
Proposed policy direction
Support proposals for diversification schemes which enable continued operation of
agricultural and other land based rural businesses particularly where they are engaged in
sustainable land management or renewable / low carbon energy, where they are appropriate
in scale to their location and, where possible, reuse existing buildings.
Support the re-use of rural buildings in the countryside for employment purposes, where they
are of permanent and substantial construction and in keeping with their surroundings. Allow
the replacement of such buildings where it would bring about environmental improvement
and a more sustainable development.
Why is this policy needed?
It is important that the plan restricts the scale of development in the countryside where large
scale development would be unsustainable. Rural buildings, such as farm buildings no
longer needed for agriculture, provide opportunities for conversion for employment uses in
the district, and provide a way of supporting the rural economy and making best use of an
existing resource.
The plan also needs to support land-based businesses and farms to continue to thrive.
To do this many have diversified into other business areas. They also need to continue
to adapt to respond to climate change and to new Government funding schemes. It is
important that diversification proposals are well founded in terms of effectively contributing
to the agricultural business and the rural economy and integrating new activities into the
environment and the rural scene.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Diversification and the re-use of farm buildings were not addressed specifically in our
First Conversation consultation. However, we did receive feedback that supported market
gardening and farming, including to produce local food and reduce food miles.
                                                                                      233

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy – This is not the preferred approach, as not including a policy would not provide
sufficient support to land based businesses, or the re-use of buildings.
2. Greater flexibility for residential uses of rural buildings – This is not the preferred
approach. Current policy requires buildings for be effectively marketed for employment first.
Removing this preference would reduce the opportunities to support the rural economy and
encourage residential development in the countryside where there is greater reliance on the
private car to access everyday services.

Policy J/AL: Protecting the best agricultural
land
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out when and how development on agricultural land and soils should be
controlled.
Proposed policy direction
Restrict development which would lead to the irreversible loss of the best agricultural land
(Grades 1, 2 or 3a) unless it is allocated in the Local Plan to meet development needs, or
sustainability considerations and the need for the development are sufficient to override the
need to protect the agricultural value of the land. In addition, the impact of development on
soils and the protection of soil quality must be considered, through careful management
during construction.
Why is this policy needed?
South Cambridgeshire has a significant resource of good quality agricultural land, and
this is a valuable resource that needs to be protected. The sector is a key economic and
environmental resource with the total farmed area of Greater Cambridge over 72,000 ha.
Much of the best agricultural land lies around Cambridge and the larger settlements, which
may be the most sustainable locations for future development. The need to identify and
maintain a supply of land for development means there is pressure for development of
agricultural land.
Farmland is also an important biodiversity asset for Greater Cambridge. Defra’s Agricultural
Policy Transition Plans for England focus support for farmers on sustainable farming
practices, including improving soil quality; creating habitats for nature recovery; and making
landscape-scale change such as establishing new woodland and other ecosystem services.
Soil is a key element of the environmental ecosystem. Some of the most significant
adverse impacts on soil occur as a result of activities associated with construction activity.
It is important that development is carefully managed to ensure that these impacts are
minimised.
The protection of peat soil is addressed under the climate change theme.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The importance of protecting agricultural land came up in responses to a wide range
                                                                                      235

of questions as part of the First Conversation. Concerns related to impact on carbon
sequestration, biodiversity and our ability to meet our food growing needs.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as national planning policy requires the
plan to consider the impact on agricultural land.

Policy J/PB: Protecting existing business
space
What will this policy do?
This policy will state what existing business space will be protected and how business space
and employment land can be changed to other uses.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will seek to protect employment land from loss to other uses in Greater
Cambridge, including specific protection for industrial sites in Cambridge. Where loss
is proposed, it will need to be justified by evidence that it is no longer needed (by being
effectively marketed, with the plan setting out what this would entail).
The following industrial sites in Cambridge will be protected from development that would
result in the loss of employment floorspace or land.
■   Cheddars Lane, Cambridge
■   Beadle Industrial Estate, Ditton Walk, Abbey
■   Henley Road and Coldham’s Road, Cambridge
■   Mercers Row Industrial Estate (including Swanns Road), Abbey
■   North of Coldham’s Lane, Cambridge (including Church End Industrial Estate and
    College Business Park).
■   King’s Hedges Road – Kirkwood Road / Kilmaine Estate, King’s Hedges
■   Ronald Rolph Court, Ditton Walk, Abbey
■   Coldham’s Lane Business Park, Cambridge
■   Barnwell Business Park, Abbey
Why is this policy needed?
Employment sites and business premises in Greater Cambridge are under pressure for
redevelopment from residential and other uses. There is a particular pressure on industrial
land in Cambridge with reduced space and rising land values pushing industrial uses out of
the city (or out of business). There is also pressure on employment land in villages.
The uncontrolled loss of employment land reduces the sustainability of local communities.
Less local employment opportunities can reduce the vibrancy of communities, and mean
people have to travel further for work, or to access local services.
For Cambridge, where the City Council’s Anti-Poverty Strategy (2020-2023) evidences
a significant proportion of residents receiving low levels of pay and/or claiming benefits,
protecting existing industrial sites is considered a vital part of developing a more inclusive
                                                                                      237

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
economy. Due to their importance key areas will be specifically identified on the policies map.
It would be unreasonable to protect employment sites in perpetuity, but we can seek to
ensure that alternative employment opportunities have been explored before sites are lost.
The policy will operate within the limits of the uses classes and permitted development rights,
which allow certain changes of use to take place without the need for planning permission.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation when we asked whether you think we should be
protecting existing business and industrial space, there was support to protect employment
land in rural areas and sustainable locations, where it meets local needs and reduces
commuting distances and the associated impacts on the environment. The need to protect
sites for specific purposes such as minerals and waste uses was also referenced.
A number of responses raised the need to assess existing employment space to review
performance against proposed carbon reduction measures in the Plan and to determine how
essential it is for certain businesses to be in Cambridge and the most appropriate locations
to continue employment uses.
We received differing views on whether to require appropriate marketing of employment sites
before change of use can be allowed. There was also a general objection to the arbitrary
protection of employment space.
There were also responses that gave examples of where employment land should not be
protected, for example, uses that are now inappropriate for the local area due to noise and
the use of the local road network by HGVs, land that is under-utilised and could be used for
residential development.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy, allow employment land to be changed to other uses without restriction – This is not
the preferred approach, as it is considered there is to the need to protect employment sites.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy J/RW: Enabling remote working
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how proposals for remote working hubs and working at home should
be considered.
Proposed policy direction
Policies will support the creation of local employment hubs, outlining acceptable types, scale
and location of development.
They will also support the partial conversion, extension or change of use of residential
dwellings to enable the residents to work at or from part of the dwelling, subject to criteria
addressing, for example, the impacts on neighbours of traffic, noise and disturbance and the
character and appearance of the proposals.
Why is this policy needed?
Whilst there has been trend towards workers working all or part of their working week
from home over recent years, the COVID-19 Pandemic has dramatically accelerated this
shift. The post-pandemic future remains uncertain; however, surveys suggest that many
companies’ workers will look to continue some level of home-working.
Many workers welcome this change, valuing the reduction in the time and money spent
commuting and the promise of flexibility in future working patterns. However, for others there
can be difficulties in working at home, including lack of space, difficulties with childcare and
the impacts on mental health of solitary working.
For firms too, particularly those in the knowledge-based economy, there can be downsides
to this remote working with the loss of human contact reducing the exchange of ideas and
innovation associated with day-to-day contact and networking.
The Local Plan could offer support to home adaptations that may be needed (although many
of these changes may already fall under Permitted Development).
Work hubs would provide shared space for workers located within buildings in local
neighbourhoods. Appropriate size would generally be dependent on the size of the local
community. In villages they would be smaller in scale but in cities and towns they could be
considerably larger.
Community work hubs could provide an accessible, sustainable solution for workers. They
could also support the development and growth of new enterprises not only through the

exchange of knowledge with peers but also by providing a focus for business support
provision. Policy is needed to encourage and enable this type of facility.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation we had a number of responses that requested policies
that support flexible and home working in order to respond to changing work patterns. The
need to provide dwellings with flexible spaces and good broadband services was highlighted
as well as cafes and co-working spaces in close proximity to homes.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – This is not the preferred approach, as the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised
the need to support flexible working arrangements.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy J/AW: Affordable workspace and
creative industries
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how affordable workspace, including for creative businesses, should
be provided across Greater Cambridge.
Proposed policy direction
It is proposed to require affordable workspace to be delivered as a proportion of larger
commercial developments. Affordable workspace can be defined as workspace that has
a rental value below the market rate (generally, 80% of the market rate or less). If on-site
provision is not possible, it is proposed to require financial contributions for equivalent off-site
provision.
To help new communities develop, major mixed use developments should incorporate an
element of affordable workspace. They should also include provision for creative and artists’
workspace, rehearsal and performance space and makerspace.
Why is this policy needed?
Our Employment Land Review presents evidence that there is a shortage of affordable
workspace for start-up businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across
Greater Cambridge. The issue is more apparent and increases further towards Cambridge
city centre.
Common issues include tenants being priced out of the market, long waiting lists for new
space and high rents. As a result, it reports, the workspace market in Greater Cambridge can
be difficult for micro-enterprises and SMEs to enter.
Providing spaces at reduced rents on easy-in and easy-out terms helps to encourage
individuals to take the leap into starting a new business or growing their homebased
business. Support from business support providers in these shared spaces can help
entrepreneurs to develop sustainable companies.
Affordable workspaces have an important role in helping to address social inclusion.
Individuals from more deprived communities will have more barriers to starting up including
access to finance and the ability to absorb risk. Access to affordable flexible spaces can help
to overcome these issues.
In several areas of London, the provision of affordable workspaces is built into planning
policy as a means of addressing shortages in premises for micro, small and medium-sized
 242

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
enterprises. Different boroughs can have different thresholds, levels and timescales for
delivery. As an example, in Richmond upon Thames, where over 1,000 m2 of office space
proposed, at least 10% of this space must be affordable. ‘Affordable’ is defined as rent and
service charges at less than 80% of market value. Under the policy the workspace must be
maintained at an affordable level for a minimum of ten years.
A next step at draft plan, if this approach is taken forward, would be to identify scale of
development it should apply to and the proportion that should be required.
As well as ensuring a sufficient supply of affordable business space, affordable workspaces
can support sectors that have cultural or social value such as artists, designer-makers,
charities, voluntary and community organisations and social enterprises for which low-cost
space can be important.
For Greater Cambridge, the creative sector has been identified as a sector that has a
significant economic role in the area and a role in supporting wider community well-being, for
example through place-making. However, it has also been identified as having a particular
need for affordable space.
Consultants looking at the supply and demand of creative workspace in Greater Cambridge
have highlighted Cambridge’s unique character as a historic university town with very few
post-industrial buildings and high demand on its current stock of commercial space. This
effectively means that there are few affordable spaces for artists and creatives to occupy and
practice in.
Their surveys of creative businesses have identified a shortage of secure, flexible and
affordable workspaces leading people to work from home or use a range of other spaces that
are less suitable.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation we asked you a range of questions focused on the
local economy and your preferences for the type and location of business and industrial
space in Greater Cambridge.
We received several responses that raised the need for new start-up, incubator and small
business and workshop space in the area including flexible workspace and co-working
hubs with shared facilities. It was felt important that these spaces could adapt to changing
circumstances. Short-term premises for pop-ups were also highlighted as an option.
The need for small, affordable start-up units in new developments was raised including
space for lower skilled businesses and to protect existing businesses. Affordability, it was
suggested, could come through subsidised or low rents.
                                                                                      243

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
There was support for the creation of creative jobs in arts and culture and the need for art
galleries and youthful cultural spaces was recognised.
The suggested locations for these spaces were not restricted to a particular area. Villages,
new settlements, expanding housing and employment areas, urban areas and rural areas
were all proposed.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy - This is not the preferred approach. The market has not provided a sufficient
supply of small workspaces to meet the demand for such space in Greater Cambridge.
Without a policy, outside the life science sector, this under provision is likely to continue.

Policy J/EP: Supporting a range of facilities
in employment parks
What will this policy do?
This policy will guide consideration of proposals for shared facilities in employment parks
and campuses.
Proposed policy direction
Support appropriately scaled leisure, eating and social hub facilities where they support the
functioning of an employment area, and they are primarily aimed at meeting the needs of
workers on site and help to manage the transport impacts of the development.
Why is this policy needed?
The success of many of the campuses and business parks in Greater Cambridge is not
just down to the employment buildings. They are supported by a mix of other services and
facilities which make it possible for workers in business to meet and share ideas, and have
access to supporting facilities that are conducive to a high quality working environment.
They also have the benefit of helping to manage the peak arrival and departure of workers
travelling to and from the site, helping to improve air quality and ease congestion and
pressure on infrastructure.
At the same time these facilities should not be so extensive that they threaten the viability of
nearby district or local centre.
With the implementation of the Planning Use Class E, which provides greater flexibility
between uses, such a policy is less necessary, but we think that making our employment
parks high quality environments for workers and visitors is such an important issue it remains
an important element of the plan.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation we asked you a range of questions focused on the
local economy.
We had some responses that suggested that the Plan should support the provision of shared
spaces within employment areas. Suggestions included co-working spaces, cafes, cycle
facilities and changing rooms and electric bike parking.

Policy J/RC: Retail and centres
What will this policy do?
This policy will cover the treatment of retail, leisure (arts, culture and entertainment) and
other city centre proposals in Cambridge (including its district, local and neighbourhood
centres), and the towns and villages of South Cambridgeshire, as well as out-of-town
development.
Proposed policy direction
We will update our policies regarding retail, leisure (arts, culture and entertainment) and
centres to adapt to the changing retail environment but also changes in national planning
policy regarding Use Class E which reduce control over changes between certain uses.
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will:
■  Support the retention of retail and leisure uses with the revitalisation of high streets. This
   includes encouraging small-scale units, to attract independent shops, leisure activities
   and small businesses to help diversify and improve the appeal of the high street as well
   as allowing local communities to meet their day-to-day needs with village shops and
   services.
■  Seek to develop a specific approach for Cambridge city centre including its shopping
   centres. This will need to recognise the likely pressure for change. Through development
   of future guidance, the Council would seek to work through the issues with landowners
   with the objective of achieving vitality and vibrancy for these important parts of the City.
■  Where planning permission is required, continue to resist the loss of retail or other town
   centre uses in existing centres and primary shopping areas where it would undermine
   their vitality or ability to serve local communities, and require proposals to support the
   character, safety, and vibrancy of existing centres and village high streets.
■  Establish a hierarchy of centres across Greater Cambridge including rural village
   shopping areas. Proposals for new and existing shops and related high street services
   will be guided towards these centres first, followed by edge of centre locations. If neither
   of these are locations are available, then out of centre locations will be considered with a
   preference for those most accessible to a centre.
■  New communities will be required to include new centres of appropriate scales to be
   created to meet the day to day needs of local communities.
                                                                                       247

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
Town and village centres play an important role in local communities, it is therefore very
important to take a positive approach to their growth, management and adaptation. We also
need to acknowledge that retail is changing, and our centres will need to adapt.
The Councils commissioned a Retail and Leisure study in September 2019, covering the
whole of Greater Cambridge to update our 2013 study. The first part of the updated study
involved the development of a baseline position, to analyse the health of each centre as well
as travel and expenditure patterns in pre-COVID-19 conditions.
The baseline study concluded Cambridge city centre, for comparison goods (higher value
goods bought less often) continues to be the most dominant shopping destination in Greater
Cambridge and the wider sub-region. In the context of a falling comparison goods floorspace
and growth in population and expenditure to the period 2020, the city’s performance sales
density has experienced a strong increase from £7,497 per m² net in 2013 to £12,539 per m²
net in 2020.
In terms of future policy direction, while Cambridge city centre remains a thriving regional
centre providing a wide range of uses including shopping, leisure and tourist related
activities, it is important that the centre can evolve in a way that supports changing
consumer, retail and leisure habits while retaining its vibrancy and appeal, by continuing to
provide for the needs of those living, working and studying in the city.
The Study’s data also demonstrated the important role of smaller local convenience stores
throughout the network of village settlements, achieving strong market shares in their
location zones. It is therefore important that these village / rural / local centres provide people
with continued access to a range of shops and services which help them to meet their day-
to-day needs. From a social and economic perspective, these services and facilities support
community resilience by providing local opportunities for employment, small businesses,
social interaction and community cohesion.
The introduction of a new Use Class (Class E – Commercial, Business and Service) into
national planning policy means that some use changes can be made potentially without
planning permission, such as shops becoming financial services, offices, or even light
industrial uses. In some circumstances changes to residential uses is possible through
permitted development rights. Our policies will need to adapt to these changes, and we will
be looking to do all we can to continue to protect the vibrancy of our centres. This includes
considering whether we should apply to government to introduce article 4 directives in
certain areas. This process allows planning authorities to have greater controls over change
of use in key areas, such as where this is having wholly unacceptable adverse impacts on
the vitality of a primary shopping area, but they are challenging to secure.

To sustain their vibrancy and vitality of our town centres, new retail should be directed
towards new and existing centres. This means out of town development proposals -
development outside a new or planned centre – will need to consider their impact on these
centres, to ensure they do not undermine their ability to serve their local community.
The Retail and Leisure Study will be updated to accompany the draft Local Plan stage in
2022. This will allow a further period to understand the retail recovery, and its implications for
shopping habits.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Feedback we received through the First Conversation included support for the location of
a range of shops, services and facilities in central areas including alternative uses to retail,
in response to changing consumer habits. These alternative uses included more leisure,
residential and office uses. There remained particular support for allowing more independent
retail stores, small retail units and businesses into these areas. Other comments included
improving high streets to make them more attractive to visitors and allowing greater flexibility
to support tourism.
Objections were raised about allowing the development of out of town shopping areas and to
allowing flexibility for changes of use in Cambridge City Centre. These alternative uses could
have a detrimental impact on the character of these areas.
In April / May 2021, additional stakeholder engagement with Cambridge’s three shopping
centres (Lion Yard, Grand Arcade and the Grafton Centre) was undertaken to better
understand their future ambitions including the impact of COVID-19. These discussions
highlighted how the city centre will need to adapt to provide a variety of uses, for both day
and night-time economies beyond retail such as food, leisure, entertainment, office, hotels,
residential. They also highlighted the need for a reactive and flexible planning environment.
What alternatives did we consider?
To not include a policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils’ consider
this policy is needed as the considerations for the different centres along with the shops and
services they provide, are essential to supporting their long-term vitality and vibrancy.

Policy J/VA: Visitor accommodation,
attractions and facilities
What will this policy do?
This policy will state where hotel and other types of visitor accommodation development
will be supported in Greater Cambridge and how the loss or gain of new hotels / visitor
accommodation will be managed.
Proposed policy direction
The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will respond to the need for new visitor accommodation
such as hotels and aparthotels. This will be informed by new assessments of visitor
accommodation needs that will be completed to inform the draft plan stage.
Proposals for new hotels and other types of dedicated visitor accommodation within
Cambridge (including its urban area extending into South Cambridgeshire) would need to be
focused on accessible city centre locations, other mixed-use and large employment areas,
on public transport corridors and where they assist with place-making.
Where planning permission is needed, the conversion of residential properties to permanent
visitor accommodation use within Cambridge (including its urban area extending into
South Cambridgeshire) will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances where it does not
adversely affect:
■   the supply or affordability of local housing including rental values;
■   residents’ amenity and sense of security; and
■   the local area’s character or community cohesion.
Existing visitor accommodation in Cambridge will be protected from conversion subject to
evidence on the viability of the current use.
Proposals for visitor accommodation within settlement boundaries in South Cambridgeshire
will be supported where the scale and type of development is directly related to the role and
function of the centre and supports its vitality. Outside settlement boundaries new visitor
accommodation through the change of use / conversion / replacement of suitable buildings
and by small scale new developments appropriate to local circumstances will be supported.
New visitor attractions in Cambridge City Centre and South Cambridgeshire’s countryside
will be supported subject to criteria such as sustainable travel.
In Cambridge, due to the level of visitors that come into the city each day, the visitor
attraction policy is intended to focus on helping the following areas:
                                                                                      251
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
■  Extending the length of visits.
■  Supporting visitor management.
■  Reducing the pressures on existing attractions within the city centre.
■  As such, new attractions would need to be limited in scale, to complement the existing
   cultural heritage of the city and assist the diversification of the attractions on offer,
   especially to better support the needs of families.
Proposals for new or extended tourist facilities and visitor attractions (excluding
accommodation) in the countryside of South Cambridgeshire should utilise and enhance the
area’s existing tourism assets, and show an identified need for a rural location.
Why is this policy needed?
Tourism is important sector for the Greater Cambridge economy. It is estimated that the total
value of tourism to the area in 2018 was over £1 billion and that in the same year it provided
over 20,000 jobs. For Cambridge, employment in the tourism sector was estimated to be
22% of total employment.
The National Planning Policy Framework explains that, in order to provide the social,
recreational and cultural facilities and services a community needs, planning policies and
decisions should plan positively for the provision and use of shared spaces, community
facilities (such as local shops, meeting places, sports venues, open space, cultural buildings,
public houses and places of worship) and other local services to enhance the sustainability
of communities and residential environments.
Applying this positive approach, prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were in
place to commission a review of the demand and supply of visitor accommodation in Greater
Cambridge to include recommendations on future provision which could be incorporated in
the First Proposals consultation. With the disruption and uncertainty caused to the hospitality
industry by COVID-19, this evidence will now be prepared to inform the Draft Plan. It is
expected that the position in respect of the tourism market for Greater Cambridge will be
clearer at this stage.
Where potential opportunities for new visitor accommodation are recommended in the study,
these will be allocated at Draft Plan stage. During the plan period, applications for visitor
accommodation may also be submitted on sites not already identified. The policy direction
above captures how the assessment of these sites would vary according to their proposed
location within Greater Cambridge.
In recent years, the use of online platforms for short term lets such as Airbnb to rent out
either whole or parts of a residential unit as temporary accommodation for a variety of
occupiers has increased in popular tourist locations and areas close to large employment

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
centres. This is particularly the case in Cambridge, including areas close to the main railway
station and Trumpington Meadows where these activities are clustered together. Although
these services provide opportunity to support good growth in cities, the widespread and
concentrated prevalence of this activity can have negative effects on housing supply and on
the amenity of surrounding local residents. These include:
■  Loss of amenity space, privacy and enjoyment of their home resulting from patterns of
   behaviour of short-term tenants.
■  Continual disruption caused by visitors moving in and out of the premises, disruptive
   occupants and associated servicing of the unit(s).
■  Frequent rotation of unknown, neighbouring occupiers undermines residents’ sense of
   security of living in their own homes.
Whilst the use of residential premises for short term lettings does not always require
planning permission, where there is a material change of use from residential to visitor
accommodation, permission would only be given in the exceptional circumstances described
in the policy direction.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In our First Conversation consultation we received a range of views, some of them
conflicting.
There were those that suggested the adoption of policies to constrain the numbers of tourists
visiting Greater Cambridge. Others wanted us to restrict tourist coaches to park and ride
sites (and expand these sites where appropriate) so that coaches do not come into the
centre of Cambridge. Concern over trade-off between hotels and residential accommodation
was highlighted and restrictions in the use of houses as Airbnbs were requested.
There was some concern over the impact of increase car journeys of a growth in tourism
in rural areas. There was support for improving sustainable transport options to visitor
attractions; for new attractions where they are accessible to or incorporate sustainable
methods of transport; and for assessing the sustainability of tourism.
We were encouraged to support an increase in visitor facilities and attractions, for example,
hotels, conference facilities, skateboarding, and to support and protect existing facilities. The
social value and well-being benefits of visitor attractions was highlighted. Waterways were
seen as a key tourism asset. The need to increase overnight stays was highlighted and there
was support for more budget accommodation on the edge of Cambridge. Cambridge East
was identified as a potential location for new tourism opportunities.
The creation of a tourism plan/strategy to support the Local Plan was suggested as was an
assessment of the need for any further hotels in the future and a Water Space Strategy.
                                                                                       253

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as the sustainability and amenity
impacts of visitor accommodation, and the significant role of tourism in Greater Cambridge,
mean policy guidance is required.

Policy J/FD: Faculty development and
specialist / language schools
What will this policy do?
This policy will state when new faculty (higher education) development, teaching hospital
facilities, specialist colleges and language schools will be supported, and the requirements
that will need to be satisfied.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to support new faculty and specialist facilities / development in Greater
Cambridge which meet the following requirements:
■  make effective use of land, including a mix of uses on larger sites to meet the needs of
   the relevant institution, and
■  take reasonable opportunities to improve circulation for pedestrians and cyclists, together
   with public realm improvements, reductions in car parking provision and the introduction
   of active frontages at ground floor level.
We propose that the development of existing and new specialist colleges and/or language
schools will be permitted where they provide residential accommodation, social and amenity
facilities for all non-local students (students arriving to study from outside Cambridge
and the Cambridge sub-region), with controls in place to ensure that the provision of
accommodation is in step with the expansion of student places. The use of family dwelling
houses to accommodate students of specialist colleges and/or language schools only is not
appropriate.
Why is this policy needed?
The University of Cambridge continues to be a world leader in higher education and
research. It is also a vital driver of the Cambridge economy and is the reason why so many
high technology and knowledge-based employers decide to locate in the city. It contributes
to, and is dependent upon, the quality of life in the city and city centre.
The University of Cambridge and its colleges are also significant employers, providing over
12,000 jobs. Their reputation and heritage continue to attract students from across the world,
tourists, language students, spin-off enterprise and medical research, and it continues to be
a vital driver of the local and national economy.
Anglia Ruskin University has made significant investment in its East Road sites which remain
the most sustainable location for future investment.
                                                                                       255

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
There are a growing number of specialist colleges in Cambridge, which is an important
centre for the study of English as a foreign language. Courses are run throughout the year
for a broad range of students, including people working in business as well as the more
traditional younger students. These institutions can have significant economic benefit
however it is important that the impacts of their growth are properly managed. Specialist
colleges and language schools can place additional burdens on the housing market.
It is therefore important to support the growth of higher education institutions, language
schools and specialist colleges while minimising the potential impact of their new
development.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Key feedback we received through the First Conversation included the following points:
■  Anglia Ruskin University highlighted the need to support modernised and enhanced
   provision on Anglia Ruskin University’s East Road site and surrounding area.
Separate stakeholder engagement with Anglia Ruskin University and the University of
Cambridge has taken place to better understand their future development ambitions
including the impact of COVID-19.
Anglia Ruskin University
■  Anglia Ruskin is developing a new masterplan for their Cambridge campus on East
   Road. This will focus on consolidation and refurbishment of campus buildings with further
   adaption to provide blended learning / teaching with a mix of on campus and off-site
   learning and teaching using digital technologies.
The University of Cambridge
■  The University will concentrate its operational and non-operational development through
   the lifetime of the next Local Plan at existing operational sites including Eddington, West
   Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, New Museums Site, Downing Site, and the
   Department of Engineering Site, in order to:
   ■   Meet new needs for academic research, teaching and supporting professional
       services.
   ■   Replace building assets that are at or nearing end-of-life or which have inadequate
       functional suitability (we have recently completed estate wide building condition
       and functional suitability surveys that will inform the forthcoming Strategic Estates
       Masterplan and an associated Capital Investment Plan). This is relevant to the
       Downing and New Museums Sites, in particular. Existing Local Plan policies for
       development of sites such as these should roll forward.

No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as this could result in unsustainable
development such as locating new faculty development in relatively less accessible
locations or not providing satisfactory mitigation measures to reduce the impact of the new
development.

3.6       Homes
In the First Conversation in 2020, there was concern expressed about potential levels
of development, but also concerns that the area was not planning for enough homes,
particularly to reflect the growing economy. These issues are addressed in the strategy
section of this consultation. Focusing on the types of homes that should be provided, there
was support for affordable housing, and a wide range of other types of need such as homes
for older people, self-build, and provision for gypsies and travellers.
Aim for our homes policies
Plan for enough housing to meet our needs, including significant quantities of housing that is
affordable to rent and buy, and different kinds of homes to suit our diverse communities.

In the Strategy section of this consultation we have explored the housing needs of the area,
and how they should be planned for. This includes identifying a range of sites to deliver new
homes to meet our needs.
In the Homes theme we set out policies that would be applied when considering planning
applications for new housing developments. They propose that schemes include high levels

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
of affordable housing and the mix of housing should respond to local needs. They propose
that new homes include enough space to deliver healthy living environments, including
outdoor space. We also include policies to meet the needs of specific groups, including the
accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Delivering new net zero carbon homes, across a variety of tenures, with sufficient indoor
and outdoor space, designed to be adaptable throughout the lifetime of their occupants, and
located close to jobs will provide many varied benefits for people and the planet. This theme
therefore connects with most of the other themes. For example: net zero carbon homes
(Climate Change) will help control energy costs making living costs more affordable, the
creation of healthy new high quality developments with green spaces and other appropriate
infrastructure (Biodiversity and Green Spaces, Wellbeing and Social Inclusion, Great Places,
and Infrastructure) will improve the health and wellbeing of residents, and providing new
homes will help businesses to meet their staffing needs (Jobs).

Policy H/AH: Affordable housing
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how affordable housing will be delivered, by specifying the size of
developments on which affordable homes will be provided and setting out the types of
affordable housing required to address identified needs.
Proposed policy direction
On sites of 10 or more dwellings 40% of new homes will be required to be affordable, except
where: there can be a proportionate reduction as a result of vacant buildings being re-used
or re-developed (as set out in national planning policy), the development is solely for Build to
Rent (see H/BR for the requirements relating to these developments), the development is for
some types of specialist accommodation that fall within Use Class C2, or the development
is solely for residential caravans (see H/RC and H/GT for the requirements relating to these
developments).
Affordable homes should be provided on-site except for in the circumstances set out in
paragraph 63 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.
Mixed tenure developments that include Build to Rent homes should make up any shortfall in
affordable homes within the Build to Rent element on the remainder of the development, so
that overall the development delivers 40% affordable homes.
The affordable housing tenures provided should include the requirements as set out in
national planning policy and guidance – the first at least 25% of the affordable homes on the
development to be First Homes, with at least 10% of all new homes on the development to
be provided as affordable home ownership products.
The plan will set out the proportion of the different affordable housing tenures for the
remaining up to 75% of the affordable homes (after the at least 25% First Homes have
been accounted for). This will take into account the issues of affordability experienced in
Greater Cambridge and also viability, but should include an element of social rent homes
in recognition that the Councils have been identified by the Government as areas of high
affordability pressure.
Affordable rents should be set having regard to the Greater Cambridge Housing
Strategy Annexe 11: Setting of Affordable Rents (Cambridge City Council and South
Cambridgeshire District Council, June 2021) or a successor document.
Affordable housing for rent homes should be designed to accommodate different family
compositions, with the bedspaces per dwelling guided by the recommendations set out in
the Greater Cambridge Housing Strategy Annexe 5: Summary of Requirements for
                                                                                     261
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Development of New Homes (Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District
Council, April 2019) or a successor document.
Affordable homes must be designed to be indiscernible from market homes, and affordable
homes should be distributed throughout the site in small groups or clusters, in accordance
with the guidance provided in the Greater Cambridge Housing Strategy Annexe 10:
Clustering and Distribution of Affordable Housing (Cambridge City Council and South
Cambridgeshire District Council, June 2021) or a successor document.
Local Lettings Plans will be required, where appropriate to help achieve mixed and balanced
communities or to prioritise housing such as for local workers or for specific groups of
people.
Applicants will be encouraged to work collaboratively with a Registered Provider, the relevant
Councils housing team, and the Greater Cambridge Shared Planning service, to discuss the
affordable housing provision and affordable tenures for a new development ahead of the
submission of a planning application.
Viability will be considered as set out in the approach included in paragraph 58 of the
National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The Greater Cambridge Local Plan will be subject
to a viability assessment at each stage of plan making, including a whole plan viability
assessment that will accompany the draft plan and be updated at subsequent stages of
plan making. Current evidence indicates that securing 40% affordable homes is deliverable
across Greater Cambridge taking account of other development costs assumed so far. The
deliverability and viability of securing 40% affordable homes on all major developments
across Greater Cambridge will be kept under review as the preparation of the Local Plan
progresses.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires the tenure of homes needed for different groups in the
community, including those requiring affordable homes, to be assessed and that the results
of that assessment be reflected in planning policies. The Local Plan therefore needs to set
out how the Councils will secure affordable homes on new developments to address the
identified need. National planning policy expects affordable housing to be provided on site,
and only allows affordable homes to be sought on developments of 10 dwellings or more.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation highlighted the need to create balanced and integrated
communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes and tenures. There was support for
prioritising the delivery of affordable housing and including a challenging target for affordable
housing, due to the shortfall of affordable housing in Greater Cambridge. Respondents

                                                     Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
highlighted a particular need for social rent housing / council housing, and affordable housing
for local workers that support the Greater Cambridge economy. Viability was highlighted as
an important consideration.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Not including an affordable housing policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as
without a policy there is a risk that the level or tenure of affordable housing provided on new
developments would not meet the needs of the area.
2. Seeking a higher percentage of affordable homes on new developments - This is not the
preferred approach, as a higher percentage would impact on viability and delivery of sites.
3. Seeking a lower percentage of affordable homes on new developments - This is not the
preferred approach, as the Cambridgeshire and West Suffolk Housing Needs of Specific
Groups study (2021) recommends that the local authorities should continue to seek as much
affordable housing delivery as viability allows.
4. Continuing the adopted Cambridge Local Plan approach of seeking 25% affordable homes
on sites of 10-14 dwellings and 40% affordable homes on sites of 15 dwellings or more - This
is not the preferred approach, as the Cambridgeshire and West Suffolk Housing Needs of
Specific Groups study (2021) recommends that the local authorities should seek as much
affordable housing delivery as viability allows and the Greater Cambridge Local Plan Viability
Study and Assessment Interim Report (2021) indicates that securing 40% affordable homes
on major developments is deliverable across Greater Cambridge.

Policy H/ES: Exception sites for affordable
housing
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the circumstances in which rural exception sites and First Homes
exception sites would be supported.
Proposed policy direction
This policy will support exception sites in appropriate locations, typically adjoining
existing settlements, and that are proportionate in scale to those settlements where
there is an identified need. A small amount of market housing will be allowed on
exception sites where it can be justified on viability or deliverability grounds. The use
of such market housing in the form of custom and self-build housing will be supported.
Community-led housing will also be supported on exception sites where it meets an
identified need for affordable housing.
Rural exception sites will be allowed in the Green Belt only when it can be demonstrated that
non Green-Belt alternative sites are not available. First Homes exception sites will not be
allowed in the Green Belt.
The Local Plan will encourage Neighbourhood Plans to consider the scope for further
encouraging the development of schemes including through the use of community led
housing initiatives such as community land trusts, co-housing and co-operatives.
First Homes are a specific kind of discounted market sale housing and fall within the
definition of affordable housing for planning purposes. The policy will be tailored to ensure
First Homes exception sites are complementary to rather than compete with rural exception
sites. This could be through, for example, the use of locally specific criteria to determine
eligibility in rural parishes.
Why is this policy needed?
Exception sites are used to deliver affordable housing in perpetuity where sites would not
normally be permitted for housing. They are typically located adjacent to a settlement and
have not been allocated for housing within a Local or Neighbourhood Plan. The approach
to rural exception sites in the current South Cambridgeshire Local Plan has been very
successful at delivering such sites to help meet local needs.
Rural exception sites support local communities by prioritising people with a local
connection to the village concerned. First Homes exception sites have adapted this idea
by focusing on First Homes to support first time buyers across the district. In both cases
                                                                                      265

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
the scheme should be proportionate to the adjoining settlement and can include an
element of market housing to support viability.
The policy will support the delivery of affordable housing, particularly in rural communities
where current levels are low and new delivery is restricted by affordable housing only being
required on sites of more than 10 dwellings.
The government has recently introduced the concept of a First Homes exception site and
they will replace entry-level exception sites. Although, First Homes exception sites will
comprise primarily First Homes they can include other affordable housing tenures where
there is evidence of need.
The government’s guidance (paragraph 026) on First Homes states that “For plan making,
local authorities and neighbourhood planning qualifying bodies are encouraged to set
policies which specify their approach to determining the proportionality of First Homes
exception site proposals, and the sorts of evidence that they might need in order to properly
assess this.”
The same guidance states (paragraph 008) that local authorities can apply their own
eligibility criteria such as a local connection criteria, a local income cap or key worker criteria.
The introduction of a First Homes exception site component, with locally specific criteria, to
the policy will ensure the policy is complementary to requirements already set out in national
planning policy but will support schemes to be more tailored to local needs within Greater
Cambridge.
It is important that the policy encourages rural exception sites and First Homes exception
sites to work in tandem enabling schemes to come forward across all settlement sizes that
address local needs but are also sympathetic to local constraints.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The First Conversation generated little response on exception sites for affordable housing
but there was support for the idea of affordable housing being prioritised for people with a
local connection. This is a central tenet of the rural exception site policy.
Additionally, many rural communities in South Cambridgeshire have been consulted on the
principle of rural exception schemes through local housing needs surveys and these have
produced a clear majority in favour of the approach.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No Policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as this would restrict our ability to
deliver additional affordable housing where it is most needed.

2. Apply a more restrictive approach to rural exception sites - Not considered a reasonable
alternative because previous policies have been successful in bringing forward sites.
3. Apply a more laissez-faire approach to the development of exception sites - This was
not identified as the preferred approach as this could lead to rural exception sites being
squeezed out by First Homes exception sites, inappropriate sites coming forward and
housing mixes being driven more by commercial gain than local need.

Policy H/HM: Housing mix
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the mix of housing to be provided by new development, to ensure that
new housing is generally of a size and type to meet the housing needs of different groups in
the community.
Proposed policy direction
New housing developments of 10 or more dwellings will be required to provide an appropriate
mix of housing sizes (number of bedrooms), with the proportions of dwellings of each size to
be guided by the housing mix for each tenure and for Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire
as set out in the recommendations from the Cambridgeshire and West Suffolk Housing Needs
of Specific Groups study (2021) and the Housing Needs of Specific Groups – Addendum for
Greater Cambridge (2021) or any future update to the Greater Cambridge Housing Strategy or
housing mix evidence published by the Councils. As the proportion of dwellings of each size is
provided as a range, this allows flexibility for local circumstances.
The housing mix (size of bedrooms) recommendations from the Cambridgeshire and West
Suffolk Housing Needs of Specific Groups study (2021) and the Housing Needs of Specific
Groups – Addendum for Greater Cambridge (2021) are as follows:
For Cambridge:
 Tenure                1 bedroom  2 bedroom  3 bedroom    Homes with
                       homes      homes      homes        4 or more
                                                          bedrooms
 Market housing        0-10%      15-25%     40-50%       25-35%
 Affordable housing –  15-25%     35-45%     25-35%       5-15%
 ownership
 Affordable housing –  35-45%     30-40%     15-25%       0-10%
 rented
For South Cambridgeshire:
 Tenure                1 bedroom  2 bedroom  3 bedroom    Homes with
                       homes      homes      homes        4 or more
                                                          bedrooms
 Market housing        0-10%      20-30%     35-45%       25-35%
 Affordable housing –  15-25%     35-45%     25-35%       5-15%
 ownership
 Affordable housing –  25-35%     35-45%     20-30%       0-10%

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Exceptions will be allowed where an alternative housing mix is justified by site specific
circumstances, such as local character, the built form of the new development, affordable
housing demand on the councils’ housing registers, and the existing housing mix in the
surrounding area.
In some circumstances a condition(s) may be added to the planning permission to remove
the permitted development rights for all or some of the dwellings if increasing the approved
number of bedrooms for all or some of the dwellings through extensions would harm the
housing mix that the development was responding to.
Policy will also encourage the delivery of a mix of types of homes – houses, flats and
bungalows – proportionally across all market and affordable tenures, taking account of local
circumstances including character and built form, and up to date evidence of affordable
housing need as demonstrated by the councils’ housing registers.
Applicants will be encouraged to work collaboratively with a Registered Provider, the relevant
Councils housing team, and the Greater Cambridge Shared Planning service, to discuss
the affordable housing mix for a new development ahead of the submission of a planning
application.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires the size and type of homes needed for different groups
in the community to be assessed and that the results of that assessment be reflected in
planning policies. The Local Plan therefore needs to set out how the Councils will secure a
mix of sizes and types of homes on new developments to address the identified need and
create balanced and mixed communities.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to First Conversation highlighted the need to create balanced and integrated
communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes and tenures that reflect the findings
of the Councils evidence of housing needs of specific groups. However, respondents also
commented that the housing mix policy should be sufficiently flexible to address viability
challenges, to address changing housing needs over the plan period, to appropriately
cater for the needs of the community it will serve, and to appropriately respond to the site
and its surroundings. There were also differing views that highlighted both a wish for more
smaller homes and microhomes – particularly for first time buyers and the homeless – to
help overcome the affordability crisis, and for more family sized homes / bigger homes that
provide flexibility. Specific comments were received highlighting a need for more bungalows
for older people.
                                                                                      269

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Not including a policy setting out a housing mix for new developments, and therefore
relying on the housing market to determine the housing mix. - Not considered a reasonable
alternative as without a policy there is a risk that the housing mix provided on new
developments would not meet the needs of the area.
2. Applying the housing mix policy to all developments. - Not considered a reasonable
alternative as it is not practical to apply the housing mixes suggested to sites of less than
10 dwellings, and for smaller sites it is important to make best use of the land and to take
account of local circumstances.
3. Not including a policy setting out a housing mix for affordable dwellings, and therefore
relying on local circumstances to determine the housing mix. - Not considered a reasonable
alternative as without guidance in the Local Plan there is a risk that the affordable housing
mix provided on new developments would not meet the needs of the area.

Policy H/HD: Housing density
What will this policy do?
This policy will ensure that land is used effectively when being developed for new housing.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will seek to deliver site specific appropriate net densities across Greater
Cambridge, taking advantage of opportunities to deliver higher densities on sites with good
accessibility subject to local character considerations.
We propose to apply a design-led approach to determine the optimum development
capacity of sites in order to make the best use of land. A design-led approach to optimising
site capacity requires consideration of design options to determine the most appropriate
form of development that responds to a site’s context and capacity for growth, existing and
planned supporting infrastructure, local character, and other local circumstances. We want
to encourage higher densities in locations which are, or will be, highly accessible by walking,
cycling and public transport.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires plans to support making efficient use of land. Land is a
scarce resource and should be used effectively and appropriately whilst being sensitive to
local character. It also highlights that city and town centres and other locations that are well
served by public transport provide opportunities for higher densities, promoting sustainable
travel modes that limit future car use. A design led approach, supported by site or area
specific design codes provides the best opportunity to achieve these goals.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The First Conversation demonstrated support for the principle of building to higher densities
in Cambridge to achieve more sustainable development and meet demand for city living.
Some considered that the approach to density should not be overly prescriptive, and should
provide flexibility to respond to site opportunities. Others highlighted the importance of
considering the importance of landscape and townscape, including the historic environment.
                                                                                       271

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Not including a density policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative because this
would limit the scope to ensure land is used effectively.
2. Applying a blanket density across the whole plan area - Not considered a reasonable
alternative as this does not reflect the range of settlements, and their differing characteristics,
within Greater Cambridge. Including a higher density requirement for the whole of Greater
Cambridge was discounted as this could encourage over-development.
3. Applying different target or guide density levels to different settlement categories in
Greater Cambridge – not considered a reasonable alternative as within settlements,
accessibility varies depending on location, and local conditions present a range of
opportunities and constraints on site capacity. Well-designed places would not be delivered
through application of density levels that do not take account of site characteristics.

Policy H/GL: Garden land and subdivision of
existing plots
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out criteria to determine when it will be acceptable for garden land and
existing residential plots to be developed for new housing.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will continue the approach of the adopted Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire
Local Plans by resisting inappropriate development of residential gardens and the
subdivision of existing plots. This will be done by reference to a range of factors including
potential harm to local character, adequacy of remaining amenity space, trees, heritage
and biodiversity. The policy will also seek to stop development that would compromise the
potential of other land to be brought forward for development.
Why is this policy needed?
Gardens are an important environmental resource; they can make a major contribution to
local character and they can mitigate fluvial and surface water flooding. However, they can
also provide scope for new residential development without the loss of countryside. This can
be a particular advantage in rural communities where residential development opportunities
can be constrained. This policy will ensure that only suitable and appropriate developments
take place on such land.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Consultation showed support for controlling the use of gardens, and
in particular the paving over of front gardens. Issues mentioned included their biodiversity
value, and their potential to help urban cooling.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - This approach is not the preferred approach as it would not provide clear
guidance on the approach that would be taken to development on garden land and
subdivision of existing plots, and could lead to inconsistent outcomes.
                                                                                      273

Policy H/SS: Residential space standards
and accessible homes
What will this policy do?
This policy will set the required standards for internal spaces within new homes, the
proportion of accessible and adaptable dwellings to be provided as part of dwelling mix, and
provision of external private and shared amenity space.
Proposed policy direction
Gross internal floor areas for all new homes will be required to meet or exceed the
nationally described residential space standard or its successor. Exceptions only where
new homes are being provided to meet a specific evidenced need (e.g. accommodation
for homeless, disabled people or specific young adults) and evidence is provided to
demonstrate that meeting this nationally described standard would result in unsuitable
homes for the identified occupants.
New homes created through residential conversions and homes created by changes of
use from non-residential land uses should seek to meet or exceed the nationally described
residential space standards as far as it is practicable to do so.
All new homes will be required to be Building Regulations M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable’
dwellings. Exceptions only where it can be demonstrated that site specific circumstances,
in addition to the other requirements for the development, make the proposed development
impractical, unachievable or unviable.
5% of affordable homes on new developments that include 20 or more affordable homes
will be required to be Building Regulations M4(3) ‘wheelchair user’ dwellings, to be
provided as Building Regulations M4(3)(a) ‘wheelchair adaptable’ dwellings unless the
Council has identified a need for Building Regulations M4(3)(b) ‘wheelchair accessible’
dwellings. Exceptions will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that there is
no evidence of need such as rural exception schemes addressing other specific needs.
All newly created homes (through conversion, change of use, or new build) will be required
to have direct access to private amenity space. We propose to develop revised minimum
space standards for private amenity space for different types of dwellings and locations.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy states that planning policies should ensure that developments
create places with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. It specifically
allows local authorities to include planning policies that make use of the nationally described
                                                                                      275

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
residential space standard and the optional technical standards for accessible and adaptable
housing.
Requiring all new homes to be Building Regulations M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable’
dwellings allows for dwellings to be adapted over time, including to accommodate a
wheelchair user(s), or to take account of other disability or mobility issues. New self or
custom build dwellings can also be designed specifically to meet the requirements of the
occupant(s) and therefore take account of any disability or mobility issues.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation highlighted a wish for new homes to meet the Lifetime
Homes standard and be designed to include flexibility to enable adaptation during the
lifetime of their occupants.
There was generally support for the Local Plan continuing to set minimum size standards
to ensure provision of sufficient indoor space, set requirements for accessibility and
adaptability of homes, and make sure that new homes have access to private gardens
and outdoor space. Respondents also commented that any requirements should not be
applied inflexibly as some people are happy with smaller homes that are high quality.
Developers highlighted that any required standards have implications for build costs, and
that it is important that these requirements are considered in the viability assessment of
the Local Plan.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. Not implementing the nationally described space standards - This is not the preferred
approach because our evidence shows that without specifically requiring the standards some
developments will be designed to provide new homes below these standards.
2. Not requiring new homes to meet Building Regulations M4(2) standard - This is not
the preferred approach because the Cambridgeshire and West Suffolk Housing Needs of
Specific Groups study (2021) provides recommendations on the percentage of new homes
that should meet this standard based on evidence of need, and accessible and adaptable
housing enables people to live more independently and it is better to build these types of
homes from the outset rather than have to make adaptations at a later stage.
3. Not requiring new homes to meet Building Regulations M4(3) standard - This is not the
preferred approach because there is evidence of need for wheelchair user homes. The
additional costs associated with providing homes to meet either of the M4(3) standards are
significant and therefore requiring a higher percentage would have implications for other
policy requirements or the overall viability of a development.

4. Not provide guidance on the provision of private amenity space for all new homes - This
is not the preferred approach because national planning policy states that planning policies
should ensure that developments create places with a high standard of amenity for existing
and future users. Outside amenity space is an important part of this and the need for it was
emphasised during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy H/SH: Specialist housing and homes
for older people
What will this policy do?
This policy will guide proposals for specialist housing (within both Use Classes C2 and C3)
designed to support a variety of groups such as older people, disabled people, people with
alcohol or drug dependency, those requiring refuge from harassment and violence, and
others who may, for a variety of reasons, be excluded from the local community. Student
accommodation is covered in Policy H/SA: Student Accommodation. The need to help older
people downsize or stay within their community through ‘whole life housing’ approaches are
also addressed in Policy H/HM: Housing mix and Policy H/SS: Residential space standards
and accessible homes.
Proposed policy direction
Provision of specialist housing will be required as part of the housing mix of new
developments, particularly at new settlements and within urban extensions, to create
balanced and mixed communities and to meet the identified need for specialist housing. The
policy will support the development of housing for older people and other groups in need of
specialist housing. It is important to recognise that those in need of specialist housing are
not a homogeneous group and the policy will need to support a broad range of specialist
housing reflecting local needs.
Proposals for new specialist housing will be considered via a criteria based policy similar to
that in the adopted Cambridge Local Plan 2018, but with the policy applying to the whole of
Greater Cambridge. The criteria will ensure that new specialist housing is provided where
there is a need, in suitably accessible locations, and without resulting in an excessive
concentration of such housing.
Any specialist accommodation provided either as self-contained units or bedspaces for
older people will contribute towards delivering the overall housing requirement for Greater
Cambridge, but any specialist housing for other groups such as children and young people,
or disabled people, will not contribute.
The provision of some forms of specialist housing, such as general housing for older people,
will be delivered through the requirements for all new homes to be accessible and adaptable
homes as set out in Building Regulations M4(2) standard (see H/SS: Residential space
standards and accessible homes).

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires the size, type and tenure of homes needed for different
groups in the community to be assessed and that the results of that assessment be reflected
in planning policies. Specialist housing is designed so that support can be provided to its
occupants where required (and often to others in the wider community) while promoting
independent living. The Local Plan therefore needs to set out how the Councils will deliver
sufficient specialist housing to meet the identified need and how proposals for new specialist
housing will be considered.
Providing specialist accommodation for older people can help people to live independently
whilst staying within their local community. It can also provide opportunities for people to
downsize if they choose to do so.
The Local Plan therefore needs to set out how the Councils will deliver sufficient specialist
housing to meet the identified need and how proposals for new specialist housing will be
considered.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation 2020 consultation highlighted the need to create
balanced and integrated communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes and
tenures that reflect the findings of the Councils evidence of housing needs of specific
groups. This included support for including specialist housing within new developments
to enable residents to move through different forms of housing while still staying in their
local area. Respondents also commented that specific allocations should be made for
specialist housing, that are close to existing homes, public transport, and medical and
community facilities.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils consider that a criteria
based policy is needed as the considerations for specialist housing are different to other
types of housing development.
2. To not require provision for specialist housing at new settlements and within urban
extensions - Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils need to set out how
they will deliver sufficient specialist housing to meet the identified need, and these new
developments should seek to deliver balanced and mixed communities.
                                                                                      279

Policy H/CB: Self- and custom-build homes
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how custom build and/or self-build homes across Greater Cambridge
will be delivered.
Proposed policy direction
5% of all new homes in residential developments of 20 dwellings or more will be required
to be custom and/or self-build, provided that the Greater Cambridge self and custom
build register is recording a demand for self and/or custom build homes when a planning
application for 20 or more homes is considered.
A mechanism will be included within the policy to allow for plots identified to be for self and/or
custom build homes to be delivered by the developer or others if the plot has not been sold
as a self or custom build plot after at least 12 months of appropriate marketing.
Proposals for individual or small groups of custom and/or self-build homes will be considered
against the policies that would apply to proposals for residential development in that location.
The policy will also allow for ‘community led’ self and/or custom build projects where the
‘community’ has formed an organisation as required by the national self and custom build
legislation and their proposed self and/or custom build development is compliant with the
proposed policy approach.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires the housing needs of those who wish to commission or
build their own homes to be reflected in planning policies. National legislation requires local
authorities to keep a register of those people seeking to acquire serviced plots within the
area for their own self-builds and custom builds, and through the same legislation local
planning authorities have a duty to grant planning permission for enough suitable plots to
meet the identified demand.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses received to the First Conversation 2020 consultation highlighted both a shortfall
in the provision of self and custom build in Greater Cambridge compared to demand on
the Councils register, and that the register is likely to overestimate demand due to the
attractiveness of the area and the ability to be included on more than one register. Some
respondents suggested that the Councils should promote self and custom build opportunities
on the edges of villages as exceptions to policy. The comments received highlighted the
                                                                                      281

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
need to include a mechanism for the delivery of self-build plots that are not taken up within a
specified timescale, and also that the viability of requiring self and custom build plots on new
developments should be sufficiently tested.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. To allow the development of custom and/or self-build housing generally as an exception
to policy - This is not the preferred approach as it is likely to hamper the delivery of rural
exception sites for affordable housing.
2. No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils have a duty to permit
sufficient plots to meet demand and the provision of sufficient plots is unlikely without a
policy.

Policy H/BR: Build to Rent homes
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out when and how proposals for Build to Rent homes would be supported.
Proposed policy direction
The policy will require that proposals for Build to Rent developments, or the amount of
Build to Rent within a mixed tenure development, do not create an over-concentration
of this tenure in a local area, are distributed across the development (if part of a wider
mixed use or mixed tenure development), and meet specific criteria in terms of ownership
and management, covenants, and tenancies. Reflecting the Greater Cambridge Housing
Strategy, planning applications would need to evidence how the scheme would support
the creation of successful places and promote mixed and balanced communities. As we
prepare the draft local plan, we will explore whether it is appropriate for more specific policy
requirements to be included that address the level of provision of Build to Rent dwellings,
which could include the amount of build to rent as a proportion of all dwellings and the scale
of development to which it would apply. Policies for new communities will include guidance
regarding individual sites in the context of issues such as housing need, potential community
impacts, and to ensure an appropriate balance with other tenures within an overall
development and the surrounding area.
Build to Rent developments should meet the requirements as set out in the Greater
Cambridge Housing Strategy (Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District
Council, June 2021) or a successor document.
The policy will require at least 20% of homes on a Build to Rent development of 10 or more
homes to be affordable private rented, and make clear that these homes will contribute towards
the overall 40% affordable homes to be provided on a mixed tenure development. Affordable
private rented homes must be designed to be indiscernible from market homes and that the
affordable homes should be distributed throughout the site in small groups or clusters.
As new homes, all Build to Rent developments must meet the nationally described
residential space standards and accessible homes standards, as set out in H/SS. Build to
Rent is also addressed under Policy H/AH: Affordable housing.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires the size, type and tenure of homes needed for different
groups in the community, including those who rent their homes, to be assessed and that the
results of that assessment be reflected in planning policies.
                                                                                      283

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Build to Rent homes can respond to a need, by proving quality homes for those who wish to
rent, which adds to the flexibility of the local housing market to respond to demand. There
is evidence of local need for this type of housing, and therefore the Local Plan needs to be
clear how any proposals for these types of development will be considered.
National planning policy guidance states that 20% is generally a suitable benchmark for
the level of Affordable Private Rent homes to be provided in any Build to Rent scheme. It
therefore follows that Build to Rent developments are unlikely to achieve the 40% affordable
homes as required on other major residential developments. Given this and that Build to
Rent developments will only provide one tenure of affordable housing, the proposed policy
direction does not change the overall requirement for 40% affordable housing on major
multi-tenure development sites, as set out in proposed Policy H/AH: Affordable housing. It
may also be appropriate to limit the proportion of Build to Rent homes within specific new
developments in order to secure the provision of affordable housing to meet our identified
need and provide mixed and balanced communities. Any such limits would still need to
enable the resulting number of Build to Rent homes to be sufficient to be delivered and
managed viably. Appropriate policies will be considered when preparing the draft Local Plan,
including considering site-specific approaches reflecting the Greater Cambridge Housing
Strategy. The draft North East Cambridge Area Action Plan already takes this approach by
proposing that no more than 10% of the total housing across the Area Action Plan should be
Build to Rent.
Based on evidence of high levels of affordable housing need, the Councils will aim wherever
possible to secure more than 20% of the homes on any Build to Rent scheme to be provided
as Affordable Private Rent homes, looking in particular for a balance between the percentage
of Affordable Private Rent homes which can be achieved and the potential rental affordability
of those homes.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses received to the First Conversation highlighted the need to create balanced and
integrated communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes, tenures, ownership and
management that reflect the findings of the Councils evidence of housing needs of specific
groups. This included support for private rented / Build to Rent accommodation, as part
of making housing more widely accessible. Respondents also commented that specific
allocations should be made for Build to Rent developments.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as national planning policy
requires the housing needs of different groups, including those to rent their homes, to
be reflected in planning policies. There is evidence of local need for this type of housing,

development will be considered.
2. To include a policy with a presumption against Build to Rent developments - This is not
the preferred approach as national planning policy requires the housing needs of different
groups, including those who rent their homes, to be reflected in planning policies. There is
evidence of local need for this type of housing, and therefore the Local Plan needs to be
clear how any proposals for these types of development will be considered.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy H/MO: Houses in multiple occupation
(HMOs)
What will this policy do?
This policy will set the standards that proposals for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs)
must meet.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to carry forward the criteria based policy for considering proposals for new
larger HMOs (sui generis use), as included in the adopted Cambridge Local Plan 2018,
but with the policy applying to the whole of Greater Cambridge. The criteria will ensure that
new HMOs are provided in suitable locations with appropriate facilities and parking, a good
standard of amenity for their occupiers, and will not have significant negative impacts on
matters such as the local amenity of the surrounding area. Reference to Circular 08/2010 will
be removed as that has been withdrawn.
We propose that all new larger HMOs (sui generis use which require planning permission)
will be required to meet the nationally described residential space standards and accessible
and adaptable homes standards, and to provide direct access to amenity space as required
for all new homes (see H/SS). We would require all new larger HMOs to meet the internal
space standards required for a HMO to be licensed, whether the HMO is required to be
licensed or not.
Why is this policy needed?
HMOs form an important part of the housing market in Cambridge, with a significant
number of HMOs occupied by students. The high cost of housing in Cambridge makes
HMOs a more affordable option for many than self-contained accommodation. HMOs can
change the nature of an area, and can be seen to be associated with negative impacts to
neighbourhoods, such as anti-social behaviours, car parking issues, and overcrowding.
The Local Plan therefore needs to set out how the Councils will consider proposals for
HMOs and the specifications that should be met so that HMOs provide a standard of
accommodation equivalent to that provided in other new residential developments.

2. To include a policy with a presumption against further HMOs - This is not the preferred
approach as it would not allow sufficient flexibility in the housing market to deliver the
housing needed for different groups, including students.
3. Not requiring new HMOs to meet space and amenity standards - This is not the preferred
approach because national planning policy states that planning policies should ensure that
developments create places with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy H/SA: Student accommodation
What will this policy do?
This policy will guide set out how and when proposals for new student accommodation for
higher education institutions would be supported.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to support the identified growth for student accommodation over the next ten
years for students attending full-time courses of one academic year or more.
New purpose-built student accommodation that reduces demand for private accommodation
occupied by full-time students will be supported where consistent with other policies and
suitable in location, type, layout, affordability and linked to at least one existing educational
establishment within Greater Cambridge providing full-time courses of one academic year or
more. Proposals will not be supported where they involve the loss of existing and planned
residential accommodation. Existing student accommodation will continue to be protected to
avoid increasing demand for housing in the private rental market.
Any student accommodation provided either as self-contained units or bedspaces will
contribute towards delivering the overall housing requirement for Greater Cambridge.
Why is this policy needed?
Students make up a significant proportion of the population of Cambridge and if adequate
provision is not made for their needs in suitable locations this would lead to significant
pressures on the local housing market. New purpose-built Student Accommodation will help
meet the identified growth needs of an existing educational institution. This provision will in
turn reduce demand for private accommodation occupied by full-time students. However, it
needs to be in the right place, where impacts can be addressed, and not have an adverse
impact on the delivery of other forms of housing. The Cambridge Local Plan includes a
criteria-based policy setting out policy requirements, it is proposed to use this policy to guide
the development of the new policy for the Greater Cambridge Local Plan.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation included the support for making provision for the
expected growth in student numbers and need for accommodation.
Stakeholder engagement has been undertaken with Anglia Ruskin University and the
University of Cambridge, to better understand their future growth ambitions including the
impact of COVID-19. This highlighted the following issues:

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Anglia Ruskin University:
■  Anglia Ruskin’s residential strategy will be refreshed in 2022 and the University will
   review its strategy and investigate matters such as ownership, nomination agreements,
   maintenance and the need for buildings.
The University of Cambridge:
■  The University and colleges are discussing the future size and shape of the student
   population and will be preparing a 10-year plan.
■  Eddington - At present, 2,000 student rooms are permitted under the outline consent.
   325 student bedrooms have already been completed. Further development of new
   student units depends on the growth in student numbers in any individual college, and
   the financing of future development. It is expected that planning applications for all of the
   2,000 student units will be submitted by 2033.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils consider this policy
is needed as the considerations for student accommodation is different to other types
of development. It is essential new development proposals are linked to existing higher
education institutions and existing student accommodation is protected. This approach will
avoid increasing demand for housing in the private rental market.
2. To include a policy with a presumption against further student accommodation - Not
considered a reasonable alternative as it would not allow sufficient flexibility in the housing
market to deliver the housing needed for different groups, including students.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy H/DC: Dwellings in the countryside
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the types of residential development that may be acceptable in the
countryside outside of defined settlement boundaries.
Proposed policy direction
Residential development is generally restricted in the countryside to avoid unsustainable
development, but there are some types of residential development that need a
countryside location.
The policy will have a number of sub-components each with its own requirements for the
development to be acceptable, and it is proposed that these are carried forward from the
South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018.
For replacement dwellings in the countryside, set out that they will only be permitted where
their design quality, scale, and impact on the countryside and local character are consistent
with other policies within the Local Plan, and where a replacement dwelling in the Green Belt
is not materially larger than the one it replaces. Make clear that the replacement of caravans
and mobile homes with permanent dwellings will not be permitted.
For extensions to existing dwellings in the countryside, set out that the extension must be
in scale and character with the existing dwelling and must not materially change the impact
of the dwelling on its surroundings. Also set out that where an original dwelling is subject to
an occupancy condition, it must be demonstrated that the extension can be supported by
the viability of the enterprise and that the cost of its occupation will not be unaffordable to
workers that meet the occupancy condition.
For the reuse of buildings in the countryside, set out that the change of use and adaptation
of redundant or disused buildings to residential use will be permitted where:
■  the buildings are unsuitable for employment use, or it is demonstrated through marketing
   that there is no demand for their development for employment use,
■  the buildings are structurally sound and are of permanent construction,
■  there will be an enhancement to the immediate setting of the buildings,
■  the form, bulk, design, landscaping and materials used in the change of use and
   adaptation are sensitive to the character and appearance of the building and locality, and
■  there is a safe vehicular site access.
For dwellings to support rural businesses, set out that permanent dwellings will be permitted
if it can be demonstrated that: there is a clear need for one or more workers to be readily

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
available at most times, the enterprise has been established for at least three years and
is financially viable, there is no other suitable or available accommodation within the site /
holding, and the proposed dwelling is no larger than that required to meet the reasonable
needs of the enterprise. Make clear that the new dwelling will be subject to an occupancy
condition, and that the removal of the occupancy condition will only be permitted in specific
circumstances. Set out when a temporary dwelling may be permitted.
For dwellings of exceptional quality in the countryside, set out that a single new bespoke
dwellings of exceptional quality will be permitted provided that:
■  the dwelling would reflect the highest standards in architecture and be recognised as
   truly outstanding or innovative,
■  the dwelling would significantly enhance its immediate setting,
■  the nature, size and design of the dwelling and site are sensitive to the defining
   characteristics of the local area and to wider views, and
■  that there are no existing dwellings on the site capable of being replaced.
Why is this policy needed?
South Cambridgeshire is a predominantly rural district with an attractive and much valued
open environment. As a result, the area is prone to speculative proposals that could
constitute unsustainable development. The policy will use a range of criteria to control
development in a way that supports rural communities, reduces unsustainable living patterns
and minimises the carbon impacts of new housing.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses to the First Conversation indicated support for policy approaches that support
the rural economy by, for example, protecting employment land and supporting existing
businesses in rural areas.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative because it would lead to uncertainty as
to how development proposals would be considered.

Policy H/RM: Residential moorings
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the criteria to be used when considering proposals for new residential
moorings.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to carry forward the criteria based policy for considering proposals for new
residential moorings as included in the adopted Cambridge Local Plan 2018, but with
the policy applying to the whole of Greater Cambridge. The criteria will ensure that new
moorings are provided in suitable locations with appropriate infrastructure and will not have
significant negative impacts on matters such as landscape and townscape, local amenity,
and navigation of the river.
Why is this policy needed?
National legislation requires local authorities to carry out an assessment of the
accommodation needs of all people residing in or resorting to their area in houseboats.
National planning policy requires local authorities to reflect the results of this assessment
in their planning policies. The Local Plan therefore needs to set out how the Councils
will respond to the need identified and how proposals for residential moorings will be
considered.
An accommodation needs assessment is being carried out which will assess the needs of
house boat dwellers. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the completion of the face-to-
face survey elements of this assessment, such that it has not been possible to complete
this assessment in time to inform this consultation. It will be available at the next stage
of plan making, and will be used to inform the draft Local Plan, including whether any
allocations are needed.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
In responding to the First Conversation the Conservators of the River Cam highlighted the
need for more residential moorings within Greater Cambridge.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as the Councils consider that a criteria
based policy is needed as the considerations for residential moorings are different to other
types of development and therefore it is necessary to maintain the quality of the river
environment and safeguard local amenity.
                                                                                      293

Policy H/RC: Residential caravan sites
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the criteria to be used when considering proposals for new residential
caravan sites.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will consider the need for residential caravan sites and/or mobile home
parks, and set out that any proposals for these uses will be considered against the policies
applicable to residential developments. However, make clear that the proposed approaches
for affordable housing (see H/AH above) and residential space standards and accessible
homes (see H/SS above) do not apply to residential caravan sites / mobile home parks.
Why is this policy needed?
National planning policy requires local authorities to assess the size, type and tenure
of housing needed for different groups in the community and reflect the results of this
assessment in their planning policies. National legislation requires local authorities to carry
out an assessment of the accommodation needs of all people residing in or resorting to their
area in caravans. This is concerned with all those who have a need to live in a caravan, and
is not restricted to the needs of Gypsies and Travellers.
An accommodation needs assessment is being carried out which will assess the needs of
caravan dwellers. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the completion of the face-to-face
survey elements of this assessment, such that it has not been possible to complete this
assessment in time to inform this consultation. It will be available at the next stage of plan
making, and will be used to inform the draft Local Plan, including whether any allocations
are needed.
Proposals for new residential caravan sites (such as mobile home parks) are proposed to
be considered in the same way as other residential development, for example providing a
suitable form of windfall site within settlement boundaries.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses received to the First Conversation highlighted the need to create balanced and
integrated communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes, tenures, ownership and
management that reflect the findings of the Councils evidence of housing needs of specific
groups. No responses specifically mentioned caravan sites or mobile home parks.
                                                                                     295

Policy H/GT: Gypsy and Traveller and
Travelling Showpeople sites
What will this policy do?
The policy will set out how the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers and
Travelling Showpeople will be provided for over the plan period, and provide policy guidance
regarding the location and design of sites.
Proposed policy direction
The Local Plan will respond to the need for new pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and plots
for Travelling Showpeople, which are currently being explored through an updated needs
assessment.
Subject to the needs identified, this is likely to be addressed through a combination of
requiring provision from large scale new communities and significant major development
sites, stand-alone allocations, and the inclusion of a policy to enable windfalls in suitable
locations.
National planning policy requires that criteria should be set to guide land supply allocations
where there is identified need that cannot be met on existing sites. The following criteria are
proposed:
■  Sites are capable of providing an appropriate environment for residents in terms of
   health, safety, and living conditions, sufficient space for accommodating and moving
   caravans and vehicles, safe vehicle and pedestrian access, and are capable of being
   provided with essential utilities.
■  The number and nature of pitches or plots provided is appropriate to the site size and
   the location, and would not have unacceptable adverse impacts on the amenity of
   surrounding land uses, the countryside and landscape character, settlement character,
   heritage or biodiversity interests, rights of way, or from traffic generated, including taking
   account of cumulative impacts.
■  The needs of residents of the site can be met appropriately by local facilities and services
   without placing undue pressure on them, and the scale of such sites does not dominate
   the nearest settled community, including considering cumulative impacts with other sites.
■  The site is located within a reasonable distance of local facilities and services including

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
A design focused policy will also be included in the Local Plan, to ensure sites are built to an
appropriate quality to meet the needs of future residents.
The Local Plan will continue to safeguard existing sites.
Why is this policy needed?
National policy, set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS), is aimed at ensuring
“fair and equal treatment for travellers, in a way that facilitates the traditional and nomadic
way of life of travellers while respecting the interests of the settled community”. It requires
local planning authorities to assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers and
Travelling Showpeople, and to set requirements to address this.
In partnership with other Councils in Cambridgeshire and parts of Norfolk and Suffolk a new
accommodation needs assessment has been commissioned and is underway. However,
it has been delayed significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this process we
are seeking to engage effectively with traveller communities, their representatives, and
other stakeholders, to understand the number of permanent residential pitches required
for Gypsies and Travellers and the number of permanent plots for Travelling Showpeople
that are needed. It has not been possible to complete this survey in time to inform this
consultation. It will be available at the next stage of plan making, and will be used to inform
the draft Local Plan and what provision is required.
Some Gypsies and Travellers have ceased to travel and therefore no longer meet the PPTS
definition for the purposes of planning. As well as those who meet the definition, the needs
assessment will seek to identify the needs of Gypsies and Travellers that no longer travel, as
part of the requirement under the Housing Act to consider the needs of people living on sites
on which caravans can be stationed. This potential need was one of the issues highlighted
by the Inspector examining the 2018 Local Plans to be addressed through this local plan
review, and the plan will need to identify how this need will be addressed.
Government policy aims to promote more private traveller provision. Whilst promoters of
a number of large sites indicated they could form part of a future dwelling mix, no stand-
alone sites were submitted for consideration during the two ‘call for sites’ consultations. This
consultation provides a further opportunity for sites to be put forward.
Sites for Travelling Showpeople need to be suitable for the storage, maintenance and
testing of items of mobile equipment. There are two existing sites in Greater Cambridge. The
South Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018 identified a modest level of need for further plots.
The updated needs assessment will provide an opportunity to get an up to date position
regarding need.
Issues of sustainability apply to Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites,
emphasised by government policy. National planning guidance also requires that local

planning authorities very strictly limit new traveller site development in open countryside that
is away from existing settlements.
To ensure that the levels of Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation
are maintained, sites are safeguarded to meet the continuing housing needs of these
communities. Safeguarding will ensure that sites are not lost to competing uses.
What have you told us through consultation?
Responses to the First Conversation considered that consultation on this issue must be
wide ranging and include the Gypsy and Traveller community, the wider community and
neighbouring authorities. A sound evidence base was important to understand needs. There
was support for the allocation of sites and to improve the quality of sites through the better
provision of support services on site. There is also support for a dispersed approach with
more and smaller sites, including temporary sites, to provide flexibility and choice.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative as plans are required to include policies
and address needs.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy H/CH: Community-led housing
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the criteria to be used when considering proposals for new
community-led housing developments.
Proposed policy direction
Recognise that community-led housing developments will be brought forward within Greater
Cambridge, and set out that any proposals for these uses will be considered against
the policies applicable to residential developments. Rural exception sites for affordable
housing (see H/ES above) and self and custom build homes (see H/CB) are examples of
developments that can be brought forward as community-led housing developments.
Why is this policy needed?
Community-led housing is where local people and community groups work together to
design and deliver new housing, and there are a range of delivery models. There are a
number of community-led housing groups operating or seeking new homes in Greater
Cambridge. Some Councils allow community led housing proposals to be considered as
exceptions to planning policy, and therefore the Local Plan needs to be clear how any
proposals for community-led housing in Greater Cambridge will be considered.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Responses received to the First Conversation highlighted the need to create balanced and
integrated communities by providing a mix of housing types, sizes, tenures, ownership and
management that reflect the findings of the Councils evidence of housing needs of specific
groups. This included support for co-housing and co-operative opportunities, as part of
making housing more widely accessible.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. To include a specific criteria based policy for community led housing - Not considered
a reasonable alternative as community led housing is a way of delivering housing
developments, and therefore the considerations for these housing developments are no
different to other residential developments.
2. To allow the development of community led housing generally as an exception to policy -
This is not the preferred approach as likely to hamper the delivery of rural exception sites for
affordable housing.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
3.7 Infrastructure
In the First Conversation in 2020 you told us how important it was having the right
services, facilities and transport opportunities available. Sustainable travel was referenced
by respondents to almost every question, that homes and jobs should be located close
to each other, and where there were opportunities to travel by walking, cycling and public
transport. You also told us that access to broadband has become crucial in the way people
live and work.
Aim for our infrastructure policies
Plan for transport, water, energy and digital networks; and health, education and cultural
facilities; in the right places and built at the right times to serve our growing communities.

The relationship between homes, jobs, and sustainable transport opportunities has been
a key influence to the development strategy proposed in the Strategy section of this
consultation. In the Infrastructure theme, we propose policy approaches which would require
developments to be located and design so that sustainable travel choices are available. They
seek to meet our changing needs, such as supporting the consolidation of goods to support

local deliveries, charging points for electric vehicles, and broadband infrastructure. Finally,
we set out how infrastructure needs will be identified as the Local Plan is drafted, and how
contributions from developers will be sought.
How does this intersect with the other themes?
Infrastructure by its very nature is a broad theme and impacts on many other themes
within the plan. With regard to climate change, enabling sustainable transport choices, and
providing infrastructure to help people meet their needs locally will assist in the journey
towards net zero carbon. Providing the required infrastructure from development at the right
time is crucial for the health and wellbeing of an area and, along with good design principles
including supporting the right mix of supporting facilities and infrastructure, helps to ensure
great places are created.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy I/ST: Sustainable transport and
connectivity
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how the transport impacts of development should be managed, and
how new development should be connected to the transport network.
Proposed policy direction
This policy will seek to deliver sustainable and inclusive communities by minimising the
need to travel and reducing travel distances, whilst ensuring there is effective and sufficient
sustainable transport mode choice and improved connectivity for everyone of any ability. It
will require development to be located and designed to reduce the need to travel, particularly
by car, and promote sustainable travel appropriate to its location.
Developers will be required to submit a Transport Statement, and for larger developments
Transport Assessment (integrating a Low Emissions Strategy) and Travel Plan, to
demonstrate how many trips will be generated by the development, their impacts (including
on health, environment and cumulative impacts), and how they will be accommodated and
addressed, maximising opportunities for sustainable travel.
Innovative and flexible solutions will be sought to internalising trips and reducing vehicle
use, including through measures such as digital infrastructure and last mile deliveries. New
developments should be designed around the principles of walkable neighbourhoods and
healthy towns to encourage active sustainable travel; the policy will ensure priority is given
to people over vehicular traffic (with low speeds), to make journeys by walking and cycling
more direct and convenient than by car. They should also protect and enhance the public
rights of way network.
Developers will be required to contribute to improvements to public and community transport
and to deliver new and improved sustainable active travel connections for non-motorised
users including for equestrians appropriate to the scale and nature of the proposal.
Additional guidance for developers on the quality of provision is being prepared in an Active
Travel Toolkit. Improvements will include enhancements to existing routes to break down
barriers to use and improve safety and capacity, as well as providing high quality new routes
to improve connections to nearby communities, services and facilities. Planned infrastructure
schemes (such as East West Rail, improvements to the A428, and schemes planned by the
Greater Cambridge Partnership and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority)
will provide significant and wide ranging improvements for active travel modes; to maximise
their benefits high quality local connections will be needed to integrate them into the wider
network and with local communities.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
This policy will require developments, appropriate to their scale and location, to deliver
opportunities for seamless interchange between different modes, for example at travel hubs,
and address the whole journey including the first/last mile. This includes accommodating
new forms of mobility, innovative solutions, and future proofing technological changes,
such as micromobility (including scooters/e-scooters), e-bikes and cycle hire, autonomous
vehicles, Mobility as a Service (MaaS).
Developments which would have unacceptable transport impacts will not be supported.
Why is this policy needed?
In Greater Cambridge emissions from transport is one of the largest contributors to
climate change. Through the development strategy proposed in this consultation we have
considered where and how future development should be planned to enable the co-location
of homes close to jobs, services and facilities so people can meet their day to day needs
locally, to reduce the need to travel by car, and to support travel by walking, cycling and
public transport. New developments should make high quality places, designed around
people, with slower traffic speeds and giving pedestrians and cyclists priority.
The Local Plan will also need respond to changing patterns of mobility and technological
innovations and set clear requirements regarding transport infrastructure and connectivity
that is expected from new developments through the planning application process.
This policy will ensure development will not have an unacceptable transport impact;
increasing vehicular trips on already congested roads or generating more trips using public
transport or the existing walking and cycling network than there is currently capacity to safely
accommodate. Wider impacts on health and the environment, including cumulative impacts,
will also be taken into consideration. Health Impact Assessments, which would be sought
by WS/HD in the Wellbeing and Social Inclusion theme, will also aid the consideration of
whether a place has been designed around people.
To reduce the reliance upon the private car and provide genuine travel choice which is
inclusive to everyone, the policy will seek to address the whole journey including the first/last
mile and seamless interchange between modes, seek to break down physical and perceived
barriers to improve connectivity, and ensure timely delivery of new and improved transport
infrastructure to accommodate new development.
The policy will reflect the aims of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Local Transport
Plan (prepared by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority as the local
transport authority) and national policy whilst addressing the specific challenges and local
opportunities within Greater Cambridge. The policy will also complement local schemes and
measures proposed by the Greater Cambridge Partnership (a local infrastructure delivery
vehicle) and Cambridgeshire County Council (as local highway authority).
                                                                                      305

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What consultation have we done on this issue?
We received a large number of comments on transport issues, responding to a range of First
Conversation questions. Respondents supported development being focussed in sustainable
locations with access to a mix of uses including jobs, education, services and facilities and
connected by sustainable transport links. Key feedback from the First Conversation included
the following:
■  Include measures which will prioritise and encourage use of sustainable and active
   modes and seek to reduce car use.
■  Support for high quality cycling infrastructure.
■  Developers should mitigate their transport impacts and help fund improved public
   transport, and a range of other measures such as Dial a Ride, shuttle buses, and car
   clubs.
■  New infrastructure should be delivered prior to first occupations, to a high quality, for
   people of all abilities, and improve connectivity of the wider network.
■  We should make provision for electric vehicles, and policies should be flexible to future
   proof and adapt to changing patterns of travel and technological solutions.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy - Not considered a reasonable alternative. Relying on the Local Transport Plan or
national policy would not provide sufficient detail to address the local context and ensure that
sustainable transport is fully considered through the planning application process.

Policy I/EV: Parking and electric vehicles
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the requirements for cycle and vehicle parking, including infrastructure
for electric vehicle charging.
Proposed policy direction
Cycle and Mobility Parking
Developments will be required to deliver, safe, secure, and convenient cycle parking at
homes, businesses, and key destinations including travel hubs. It is proposed to continue to
set minimum standards for numbers of cycle spaces.
Cycle parking areas will need to accommodate non-standard cycles, mobility scooters,
electric cycles, accessories, and should make provision for cycle maintenance. Where
garages are intended to accommodate parking for both cars and cycles, they will need to be
provided to a minimum size to ensure they are fit for purpose. Security is an important issue,
and spaces should be internal where practicable and appropriate.
Larger developments and those within accessible locations will need to be able to
accommodate space for dockless cycle hire schemes, such as at travel hubs and key
destinations.
Car Parking
The quantity and type of car parking provided at a development will be informed by the mix
of land uses, location and accessibility of the development by walking, cycling and public
transport, to ensure an appropriate level to accommodate local needs (including the need for
disabled people parking) whilst avoiding a proliferation of car parking in locations with good
accessibility.
The policy will require parking to be accommodated within the public realm to improve the
quality of place, will encourage innovative and flexible solutions to reduce car parking in
appropriate locations, such as through smart parking and the provision of car clubs and
shared parking, including car barns on the edge of accessible larger developments, whilst
avoiding displacement parking.

                       Charging
                                     Points
Vehicle parking should include electric charging infrastructure (with appropriate grid
reinforcement), which should be designed into the public realm, to address the national
                                                                                      307

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
commitment to phase out the sale of petrol and diesel cars within the plan period. Charging
infrastructure should be able to accommodate other vehicles including mobility scooters,
electric cycles and electrification of the bus fleet.
Where car parking is provided, it is proposed that electric car charging points (minimum of
7kW) should be included at all developments at the following levels:
■  Dwellings with private parking: 1 charge point per dwelling (100% active)
■  Communal parking areas: 1 charge per parking space (50% active, 50% passive)
■  Employment: 30% with active charge points, and 30% with passive.
■  Retail: 20% of bays with active charge points, and 20% with passive.
Developers will be required to submit evidence of a management strategy for any communal
charge points.
Why is this policy needed?
There is a higher propensity to cycle in Greater Cambridge than nationally and increased
use of electric cycles is enabling longer journeys. The plan needs to support this sustainable
mode of travel making the parking of all types of cycles secure and convenient, and avoiding
the problems caused by insufficient spaces. The plan needs to support people using mobility
scooters and new forms of micro-mobility, by providing secure parking and access to electric
charging.
The plan needs to support people using mobility scooters and new forms of micro-mobility,
by providing secure parking and access to electric charging.
Car Parking is important so vehicles can be stored safely where they don’t cause highway
problems. Parking displacement and inappropriate car parking impacts on quality of place,
causes nuisance and can hinder emergency services. However car parking is land hungry,
can be unsightly, undermines the quality of place, and can discourage travel by sustainable
modes.
Local Plans can set parking standards, which specify the number of spaces that need to go
with different types and scales of development. These can be set as maximum standards
in certain circumstances, such as to manage traffic in town centres. Policies for Greater
Cambridge need to address a wide range of locations, from very rural villages with limited
bus services, to City centre areas where the car may actually be the least convenient way to
make a local journey. One standard will not fit all of these locations.
The Cambridge Local Plan 2018 currently includes a set of maximum car parking standards,
which restrict parking particularly in the central areas. The South Cambridgeshire Local Plan
2018 includes indicative parking standards, that respond to the more rural nature of the area.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
However, both plans acknowledge that a site by site design-led approach is needed with
flexibility to respond to the local circumstances of each site.
As part of the response to climate change the Local Plan needs to support sustainable
travel. Significant transport improvements are planned to public transport and cycle routes
in Greater Cambridge by the Greater Cambridge Partnership and Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough Combined Authority.
The Greater Cambridge Partnership are also preparing an Integrated Parking Strategy
looking at the management of on- and off-street car parking as part of wider ambitions
for achieving modal shift away from the private car. As part of place making we need to
make places where people want to move around by walking and cycling, so they are not
car dominated, and where people access their destinations by public transport. Controlling
parking levels in accessible locations is part of this.
When using maximum standards there is a tendency for them to become the default level,
rather than respond to site specific circumstances. We are therefore proposing that we
move to a more design-led approach, supported by indicative standards tailored to reflect
different circumstances. These standards could be included within future design guidance
or Supplementary Planning Documents. This would allow flexibility to adapt to changing
patterns of car ownership and use through the plan period.
As well as the amount of parking, we want to support better design solutions. Cars are
unused for the majority of the time, with some people only requiring a car for occasional
journeys, coupled with the trend for less young people to take up driving and owning a
car. We will seek to encourage innovative and flexible solutions to reduce car parking in
appropriate locations, such as through the reallocation of spaces for car clubs (which should
use electric vehicles and accommodate disabled users), and provision of shared parking
including in car barns where vehicles are stored off-plot.
With Government seeking to phase out sales of new petrol and diesel by 2030 it is vital that
new developments are ready to support electric vehicles. The recommendations proposed
regarding charging points have been informed by the Greater Cambridge New Zero Carbon
Study 2021. Acknowledging that take up will grow, some of the provision will be passive, able
to be activated when there is demand, avoiding the need to retrofit. Accommodating charging
will also have to be reflected in the design of places, for example minimise conflicts such
as cables across pedestrian and cyclist routes. In major sites charging for other types of
vehicles such as buses, may also be needed.
Charging infrastructure for cycles may encourage take up of electric cycles for some
journeys previously considered too far to cycle. Appropriate charging infrastructure may also
be required to enable the electrification of the local bus fleet.
                                                                                       309
---
Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Respondents to the First Conversation supported measures to provide accessible and
well-designed cycle parking at stations and public transport hubs, and suggested cycle
parking standards need to be updated to provide for a range of cycles and provide
maintenance facilities.
There were suggestions for car free zones and the replacement of parking spaces with
tree planting, whilst ensuring availability of disabled parking. There is support for measures
to reduce car parking including through smart parking, provision of shared spaces and
community ownership of zero carbon vehicles.
There is support for electrification of buses and provision of electric vehicle charging
infrastructure.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as national planning policy requires
consideration of parking.
2. Set specific standards for car parking provision. - This is not the preferred approach as the
flexibility provided by a design-led approach to car parking is favoured for the reasons given
above, but we would welcome views on this approach.
3. Do not set requirements for vehicle charging - This is not the preferred approach given
the need for developments to respond to climate change, and to adapt to changing vehicle
types.

Policy I/FD: Freight and delivery
consolidation
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how the development of delivery hubs should be considered, and how
development proposals should provide space for servicing, storage and deliveries.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to seek opportunities to reduce the number of freight and servicing vehicles and
their environmental impact on Greater Cambridge, particularly at peak times, while promoting
movement of freight by rail and sustainable transport modes.
We propose to support development / enhancement and safeguarding of local delivery hubs
that help consolidate deliveries into Cambridge and reduce vehicle traffic, where they accord
with other policies in the plan, provided they do not cause unacceptable impacts on Greater
Cambridge’s strategic road networks, and:
■   reduce road danger, noise and emissions from freight trips
■   enable sustainable last-mile movements, including by cycle and electric vehicle
■   deliver mode shift from road to rail where possible (without adversely impacting existing
    or planned passenger services).
We propose to require development to facilitate safe, clean, and efficient deliveries and
servicing. Provision of adequate space for servicing, storage and deliveries should be made
off-street, with on-street loading bays only used where this is not possible.
Why is this policy needed?
On-line shopping and services deliveries to business generate large amounts of vehicle
movements. In cities like Cambridge this can add to vehicle congestion, and impact on
the local environment. Local delivery hubs could provide opportunities for deliveries to be
consolidated to reduce the number of trips, or transferred to other delivery modes such as
electric bikes. This policy proposal explores how we could support delivery of these hubs.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Respondents to the First Conversation saw freight and delivery consolidation as important to
achieving net zero carbon and active travel ambitions. There was concern about the impacts
of increasing Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) traffic. There was support for restricted deliveries
                                                                                      311

in urban centres to low-traffic times, and using innovative measures such as using cargo
cycles for local deliveries and the provision of cycling logistics depots.
What alternatives did we consider?

goods are distributed locally.

Policy I/SI: Safeguarding important
infrastructure
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out what infrastructure should be safeguarded from the impacts of
development, and how this should be assessed.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to safeguard the following strategic and important infrastructure from being
negatively impacted by development:
■   Lord’s Bridge Radio Telescope
■   Existing rail freight facilities and sidings at Duxford, Foxton, Fulbourn and Whittlesford
We propose to work with strategic infrastructure providers, regional and sub regional
bodies to consider whether any planned strategic infrastructure should be safeguarded in
accordance with any national or sub regional/regional policy or approval mechanism. Any
future land identified that will be required for safeguarding purposes will be shown in policies
maps at later stages of the Local Plan process.
Why is this policy needed?
The internationally important Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory at Lord’s Bridge contains
unique radio and optical telescopes which are susceptible to interference. Arrangements
are made to consult the University of Cambridge about the technical consequences for the
Observatory of proposed development. Harm caused to the Observatory will be overcome
with the use of conditions or planning obligations to regulate the installation and use of
equipment likely to interfere with the operation of the Observatory.
There are a number of railway sidings, which either are used, or have the potentially to be
used in the future. These will continue to be safeguarded. There are also number of major
projects, particularly for transport, going through regulatory processes outside the Local
Plan. Depending on the stage these have reached when the Local Plan reaches its final
stages, it may be appropriate for these to be identified on the policies map and safeguarded.
This will be kept under review as the plan is being prepared

Policy I/AD: Aviation development
What will this policy do?
This policy will control development proposals related to aviation, and set out in what
circumstances, and how, developments should take account of aviation safety.
Proposed policy direction
At Cambridge Airport, whilst it remains operational, aviation development will only be
supported where it would not have a significant adverse impact on the environment and
on residential amenity. For other airfields, it is proposed to carry forward the aviation
policy included in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan which seeks to ensure aviation
development does not negatively impact the environment, landscape and adverse lighting,
noise, public rights of way, nature conservation interests or human health and safety, and
impact of potential deliver of renewable energy.
Any proposed development within an identified Airport Air Safeguarding Zones will
be subject to consultation with the operator of the airport and the Ministry of Defence.
Restrictions in height, or changes to the detailed design of development may be necessary
to mitigate the risk of aircraft accident and maintain operational integrity.
Why is this policy needed?
Greater Cambridge has a long association with flying and, in addition to Cambridge Airport
there are a number of established aerodromes and smaller airfields in the district, including
IWM (Imperial War Museum) Duxford with its large collection of flying historic aircraft and
internationally renowned air shows. Policies are need to ensure aviation development does
not negatively impact environment and human health, and that impacts of proposals are fully
considered.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The First Conversation consultation did not specifically consult on this issue.
What alternatives did we consider?
No Policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as there is a need to provide policy
guidance to ensure impacts of proposals, and air safety, are fully considered.

Policy I/EI: Energy infrastructure
masterplanning
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out the requirements for energy infrastructure to support development.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to require energy masterplans for residential developments and non-residential
development of a scale and nature that would allow for the benefits of smart energy
management to be identified and secured. It is proposed that the requirement would apply to
developments of over 100 dwellings.
Energy masterplans should include an assessment of the capacity of infrastructure to
support the development, any necessary reinforcements and the approach to energy
provision to support net zero carbon development, smart energy management to reduce
peak loads and greenhouse gas emissions and the electrification of transport giving
consideration to site wide approaches.
The policy will also safeguard land required to support the reinforcement of existing
electricity infrastructure, for example land adjacent to existing primary sub-stations, from
other forms of development.
Why is this policy needed?
Work carried out to assess electricity grid capacity for Greater Cambridge has highlighted
the need to triple capacity to support the development already planned in the area
and electrification of transport. The electricity grid serving the Greater Cambridge area
has seen a significant growth in renewable and low carbon energy generation. Major new
developments are often accompanied by new energy generation capacity in order to meet
carbon reduction requirements and, in some cases, to meet funding requirements. The
transition to net zero carbon is also placing new pressures on electricity infrastructure, with
the electrification of heat and transport all leading to a need for reinforcement and additional
capacity on the grid.
While these capacity issues can be resolved through traditional grid reinforcement routes,
there are opportunities to take a more joined up approach to infrastructure provision in order
to support the transition to a net zero carbon society and open up the potential for some
infrastructure to be forward funded to help speed up the delivery of key development sites.
While the Local Plan will be supported by work to assess electricity infrastructure capacity
in the area, this assessment is at a very high level, and presents a picture of capacity as a
                                                                                       317

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
moment in time. As more detailed work on the masterplanning of strategic developments
progresses, greater clarity can be provided as to actual energy requirements and the
infrastructure required to support development. This policy seeks to ensure that this
approach is integrated at a very early stage, via the development of energy masterplans for
strategic developments. This approach may also help to support the forward funding of such
infrastructure.
A grid capacity study and energy masterplan has already been developed for the North
East Cambridge Area Action Plan. This work considered the energy requirements of the
North East Cambridge development, current capacity of the primary sub-station serving
the area, options to deliver the necessary reinforcement of that sub-station and the energy
options to support the development of the site. Studies for strategic developments could
follow a similar format.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
There was support through the First Conversation consultation for the reinforcement of
electricity infrastructure, utilising renewable energy generation, smart management and
energy storage. There was a recognition that infrastructure should contribute towards net
zero carbon targets, with support for the development of heat networks as well as emerging
new technologies such as hydrogen.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – This is not the preferred approach as energy infrastructure availability has
become an important issue in Greater Cambridge particularly with the growing emphasis on
renewable energy. It is important this addressed in a planned way by major developments
rather than on an ad-hoc basis.

Policy I/ID: Infrastructure and delivery
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how necessary infrastructure to support development should be
delivered.
Proposed policy direction
We propose to only permit development if there is, or will be, sufficient infrastructure capacity
to support and meet all the requirements arising from the new development, at the time when
they are needed. Developers will be required to deliver infrastructure directly, or contribute
through planning obligations, community infrastructure levy or its successor.
Infrastructure needs will be informed by an Infrastructure Delivery Plan and schedule which
will accompany later stages of the Local Plan.
Why is this policy needed?
New development creates additional demand for infrastructure and services, and it is
reasonable for developers to address these needs in order that development is sustainable.
This could include delivery of infrastructure on site as part of developments, but also
contribution towards off site infrastructure.
National planning policy requires plans to set out the contributions expected from
development. This includes the level of affordable housing expected to be included on sites,
but also on a range of other issues such as transport, education, and green spaces. These
requirements should not undermine deliverability of the plan.
An Infrastructure Delivery Plan is being prepared to accompany the new Local Plan. This
will identify the infrastructure that is needed, when it is needed, and how much it costs.
In November 2020 we published an interim report looking at the infrastructure needs of
different options available to the plan. We have now published a further interim stage,
looking at the infrastructure needs of the proposals set out in this consultation. More detailed
and comprehensive plans will accompany the draft local plan, which will evolve as the plan
moves towards adoption.
Whilst much of the infrastructure needed is local to development sites, Greater Cambridge
also needs strategic infrastructure like major transport infrastructure, and utilities
improvements such as to the electricity grid. These take time to bring forward, and the
infrastructure plan will identify when these are needed in order that they are available and do
not slow down developments.
                                                                                       319

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Infrastructure delivery is complex, with a range of organisations responsible for the delivery
of different types. On transport infrastructure we will work closely with the Cambridgeshire
and Peterborough Combined Authority (in their role as Local Transport Authority), the County
Council, and the Greater Cambridge Partnership.
The timing of infrastructure relative to the development is very important to the community,
as people are concerned about pressure on existing communities. Whilst desirable, it is
not always practicable to deliver all the planned infrastructure upfront before development
starts, but a phased approach is needed so that it becomes available as the development
progresses.
Government are currently reviewing the mechanisms for securing developer funding. We
will await the outcome of this review before determining the precise mechanisms of how the
local plan will address developer contributions.
When plans are prepared they need to be accompanied by evidence to show their
proposals are viable, such that development can actually happen. That developments can
afford to meet all the policy requirements in terms of the standards set by the plan and the
contributions to infrastructure they are required to make. Government guidance sets out how
this should be tested. We published an initial viability assessment in November 2020, and
have now published further viability assessments testing the proposals in this First Proposals
consultation. Further viability testing will be carried out as the draft plan is prepared, and
more detailed policies for sites are developed.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
The First Conversation consultation asked several questions relating to infrastructure.
Consultation responses raised several issues around the level, requirement, and location of
infrastructure to support housing and employment development.
Respondents stated that the level of infrastructure provision should be commensurate with
the levels of development proposed in the plan. It was important that existing infrastructure
deficits are addressed before the delivery of housing. The timing and impact of development
on existing services was a common theme, with particular issues highlighted from village
communities.
What alternatives did we consider?
No policy – Not considered a reasonable alternative as this would not provide sufficient
clarity regarding the requirement of developers to mitigate the impacts of their developments,
what infrastructure was needed and when, and how it would be secured.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Policy I/DI: Digital infrastructure
What will this policy do?
This policy will set out how developments should contribute to Greater Cambridge’s
requirements for broadband, mobile phone and smart infrastructure.
Proposed policy direction
Applicants will be required to submit a ‘Connectivity Statement’ with a planning application to
demonstrate how their proposed digital infrastructure will meet policy requirements outlined
below:
Broadband infrastructure
We propose that development proposals must provide gigabit capable connections, via
multiple providers. where available, to each premise.
In locations where gigabit capable connectivity is currently available, the development will be
expected to include the infrastructure to connect to these services and make them available
to occupiers.
In locations where gigabit capable connectivity is not currently available, applicants will
be expected to demonstrate that they have engaged a range of providers to upgrade
infrastructure to deliver gigabit capable connections.
Where one or more providers have agreed to provide gigabit capable connectivity, the
development should be designed to connect to this service and make it available to
occupiers.
Where no agreement can be reached to provide gigabit capable connectivity at the
present time, Superfast Broadband may be considered as an alternative. In addition, the
development will be expected to incorporate dedicated telecommunications ducting to
enable the provision of gigabit capable connectivity in the future.
In all cases, to encourage competition and consumer choice, this will include the provision of
multiple ducts to enable several providers to access the site.
Gigabit capable broadband connectivity delivers download speeds of up to 1Gbps, the
equivalent of 1,000Mbps. This compares to Superfast Broadband which provides speeds of
30 Mbps or more.

Mobile phone infrastructure
We propose that major development proposals of 250 homes or 10,000m2 must carry out an
assessment of whether the current mobile coverage and capacity is suitable for the proposed
new development.
In locations where mobile coverage is deemed suitable, no further action is required however
the design of the development should consider the impact of building design on mobile
coverage for existing and future occupants and take appropriate action to mitigate any
adverse impacts.
In locations where mobile coverage is either available but the quality is poor and/or is
expected to be impacted by capacity constraints or where coverage is not currently available,
applicants will be expected to demonstrate that they have engaged with Mobile Network
Operators (MNOs) to determine a strategy to ensure that mobile coverage can be improved
and maintained at the site.
Where one or more MNOs agree to make improvements to their mobile coverage it must be
confirmed whether this will be via:
■   MNOs adjusting their existing assets to improve coverage for the new development.
■   MNOs and the applicant agreeing a location for additional masts and/or aerials for
    which the applicant will facilitate installation including the provision of power, full fibre
    connectivity and maintenance access.
■   Any other approach agreed with the MNO.
Where no agreement can be reached to improve mobile coverage at the present time, the
applicant must ensure that an appropriate location(s) for new mobile infrastructure is made
available for future use, this can be in the form of roof-space, building frontage space,
highways space or other land, all of which must have suitable access arrangements in place
for installation and maintenance for the life of the installed asset. A suitable power supply
and fibre connection must be made available to the location(s).
Small cell mobile communications technology
We propose that development proposals of 30 homes or 1,000m2 employment space must
include suitable infrastructure that would support any future rollout of the latest small cell
mobile communications technology. For example:
■   Require the design of street furniture in such a way that the installation of telecoms
    equipment and other sensors can be included and easily maintained without causing
    disruption.
■   Ensure that fibre connections are easily accessible to enable connection to street
    furniture such as street lighting columns to facilitate future improvements.
                                                                                      323

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
As the micro cell technology is still in development the Local Authority will provide the latest
guidance on the design requirements.
Publicly
             accessible
                            Wi-ﬁ
We propose to encourage premises and spaces where there are significant levels of use by
members of the public to have regular access to provide publicly accessible Wi-Fi.
Why is this policy needed?
The growth of connectivity over the last decade has resulted in digital technologies
increasingly affecting many aspects of contemporary living. As a result, high quality
connectivity is becoming an integral requirement for new developments.
Greater Cambridge’s economy is driven by businesses in knowledge-based sectors with
businesses that rely on the use of cutting-edge digital technology. Cambridge Cluster
Insights estimates that employment in knowledge intensive businesses in Greater
Cambridge in 2019/20 was over 48,000 with just under 16,500 of these employed in
information and communications technology (ICT) businesses. Indeed, for businesses
across all economic sectors good connectivity is becoming a key element in achieving
productivity growth.
The importance of good connectivity across the economy has been amplified by the
behavioural changes from COVID-19 that has seen a significant rise in the number of people
working from home. The ONS Labour Market Survey found that in April 2020, 46.6% of
people in employment in the UK did some work at home. Of those who did some work from
home, 86.0% did so as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of nearly a thousand
company directors by the  Institute of Directors (IoD) in September 2020 shows that 74%
of the business that responded plan to keep increase homeworking after COVID-19.
Access is to good digital infrastructure in the home is not only important in supporting
business growth. Digital connectivity is increasingly vital in supporting the wellbeing and
social inclusion of local residents. Its absence can impact on the educational, employment,
financial and health outcomes of individuals and families. It can lead to social isolation and
an inability to participate in local communities.
There is a growing need to ensure that connectivity in Greater Cambridge supports existing
and future demand; to not only support good internet and mobile phone access for residents
and businesses, but also, via 5G and small cell technology, to provide a platform for “smart”
technologies, including environmental monitoring and management, health, energy efficiency
and future transport solutions.

                                                       Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
The Government has committed to being a world leader in 5G, the next generation of
wireless communications technology, with the majority of the population covered by 2027.
5G is likely to require both existing mobile infrastructure and small cell technology in order to
provide the capacity needed for the large numbers of users and devices that it is expected
to support and for the significant levels of data required for the future application of smart
technologies.
Small cells are typically embedded in street furniture such as lampposts, advertisement
panels, bus shelters or street signs. Due to the small size of the technology, the provision
of street furniture that will have the ability, at some future time, to contain small cells it is
not expected to have a significant impact on development costs. For example, a significant
proportion of lampposts across the UK already have sufficient capacity / space to retrofit the
technology.
What consultation have we done on this issue?
Respondents to the First Conversation commented that digital infrastructure has an
impact on a wide range of issues, including the economy, reducing the need to travel and
responding to climate change. A summary of respondents’ key points are as follows:
■  Respondents thought that including a policy relating to Digital Infrastructure in the new
   Local Plan to ensure the delivery of high quality gigabit capable digital connectivity was
   important.
■  Respondents saw high quality broadband as key to encouraging homeworking and
   remote working from rural locations, stating that it should be considered when drafting
   infrastructure, housing and design policies for the new Local Plan.
■  Respondents commented that land should be allocated to support growth in a range
   of high technology employment sectors, all of which require high quality digital
   infrastructure.
What alternatives did we consider?
1. No Policy – This is not the preferred approach due to the importance of provision for
economic, social and climate change.
2. Continuing the current policy approach by just requiring ducting rather than for
actual connections – This is not the preferred approach as this is insufficient to ensure
infrastructure is delivered to support development.

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Appendix 2: Glossary
Adopted 2018 Local Plans:        The current Local Plans in Cambridge and South
Cambridgeshire were adopted in 2018, and can be viewed on the Councils’ websites:
Cambridge Local Plan 2018: https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/local-plan-2018 South
Cambridgeshire Local Plan 2018: https://www.scambs.gov.uk/planning/local-plan-and-
neighbourhood-planning/the-adopted-development-plan/south-cambridgeshire-local-
plan-2018/
The adopted 2018 local plans set out the vision and strategy for the area over a length
of time and provide the basis for decisions on planning applications. Local Plans can be
adopted after they have been through a plan making process involving consultation and
examination in public.
Aggregates: Aggregates take a number of different forms. Primary Aggregates include
naturally occurring sand, gravel and crushed rock typically used for a variety of construction
and manufacturing purposes. Recycled Aggregates are typically produced from construction
and demolition wastes. Secondary Aggregates are aggregates typically derived from a range
of industrial and mineral wastes such as power station ash, glass, and mineral site spoils.
Affordable Housing: Housing for sale or rent for those whose needs are not met by
the market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or
is essential for local workers). Eligibility is determined using local incomes and local house
prices.
Air Quality Management Area (AQMA): Air Quality Management Areas are
designated in areas where there are recorded exceedances of the national objectives for
annual mean nitrogen dioxide and daily mean particulate matter (PM10). To improve air
quality an Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) is prepared which identifies practical, feasible and
cost-effective measures that can be implemented.
Amenity: Element of a location or neighbourhood that helps to make it attractive or
enjoyable for residents and visitors.
Apart-hotel: Self-contained hotel accommodation (C1 Use Class) that provides short-term
occupancy purchased at a nightly rate with no deposit against damages. This will usually
include concierge and room service, and include formal procedures for checking in and out.
Area action plan (AAP): A local plan document setting out policy and proposals for a
specific area.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Areas of major change: Set out opportunities for redevelopment or improvement within
the city centre itself or at the edge of the city centre.
Battery storage: An energy storage system that captures energy produced to be used at
another time. They are suitable for a range of applications, including vehicles and buildings.
Biodiversity: The variety of life in all its forms. This includes the plant and animal species
that make up our wildlife and the habitats in which they live.
Biodiversity Net Gain: Is a requirement of the NPPF and Environment Bill 2020 that
seeks to ensure new development minimise losses of biodiversity, helps to restore ecological
networks, and provides an overall increase in natural habitat and ecological features.
Brownfield land: See ‘Previously Developed Land’.
Build to Rent (BTR): Purpose built housing that is typically 100% rented out. It can
form part of a wider multi-tenure development comprising either flats or houses, but should
be on the same site and/or contiguous with the main development. Schemes will usually
offer longer tenancy agreements of three years or more, and will typically be professionally
managed stock in single ownership and management control.
Building density: Building density is the “floor area ratio” – the ratio of built floor area to
land area. This is the most widely used measure for limiting the bulk of development on any
given plot of land.
Building Regulations: The Building Regulations 2010 cover the construction and
extension of buildings, providing the minimum standards for design, construction and
alterations to virtually every building. Building regulations approval is different from planning
permission and you might need both for your project.
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method
(BREEAM): BREEAM is a set of standards for measuring the environmental performance
of a range of new and existing building types. It covers energy and water performance,
construction materials, waste, ecology, pollution and health. Under this scheme,
buildings that meet the standards are rated either ‘pass’, ‘good’, ‘very good’, ‘excellent’ or
‘outstanding’.
Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority: Made up of
representatives from eight organisations. These are Cambridge City Council,
Cambridgeshire County Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council, Fenland District
Council, Huntingdonshire District Council, Peterborough City Council, South Cambridgeshire
District Council and The Business Board. The Combined Authority is held to account by
several committees made up of representatives from partner local authorities. The Authority
                                                                                      353

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
is led by Mayor, Dr Nik Johnson, who was elected on 10th May 2021.
www.cambridgeshirepeterborough-ca.gov.uk
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Minerals and Waste Plan: The Minerals
and Waste Local Plan sets the framework for all minerals and waste developments, adopted
by Cambridgeshire County and Peterborough City Councils. There is also an adopted
Policies Map, which shows allocated sites and areas of search for future minerals and waste
facilities, and safeguarding areas for existing and future facilities.
Car Barn: A multi-storey car park which is positioned on the edge of a district/
neighbourhood in order to reduce the number of vehicles using residential streets. Can be
designed so that they complement their local environment.
Car Club: Car club is a membership scheme that offers people use of a car on a pay-as-
you-go basis.
Carbon sink: A carbon sink is anything that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere
than it releases – for example, plants, the ocean and soil.
Circular economy: An economic model in which resources are kept in use at the highest
level possible for as long as possible in order to maximise value and reduce waste, moving
away from the traditional linear economic model of ‘make, use, dispose’.
Climate change adaptation: Adapting to life in a changing climate involves adjusting
to actual or expected future climate. The goal is to reduce our vulnerability to the harmful
effects of climate change (like sea-level encroachment, more intense extreme weather
events or food insecurity).
Climate change mitigation: Action to reduce the impact of human activity on the
climate system, primarily through reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Cluster: Concentrations of companies in related activities, recognisable suppliers, service
providers and institutions, which are cooperating, competing and collaborating to build
competitive advantage, often across traditional sector boundaries. Such concentrations often
depend on access to specialist skills and infrastructure within a specific area.
Connectivity: Connectivity describes the extent to which urban forms permit (or restrict)
movement of people or vehicles in different directions. Permeability is generally considered
a positive attribute of an urban design, as it permits ease of movement and avoids severing
neighbourhoods. Urban forms which lack permeability, e.g. those severed by arterial
roads, or with many long cul-de-sacs, are considered to discourage movement on foot and
encourage longer journeys by car.

                                                      Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Conservation Area: Areas of special architectural or historic interest, the character or
appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. You can
   find more information on the Councils’ websites:
   Cambridge: https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/conservation-areas
   South Cambridgeshire: https://www.scambs.gov.uk/planning/natural-historic-
   and-built-environment/historic-environment/conservation-areas/
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP): Outlines how a
construction project will avoid, minimise or mitigate effects on the environment and
surrounding area. CEMP will often detail the implementation of measures in accordance with
environmental commitments outlined in; an Environmental Statement, Policy requirements,
requirements of planning conditions, planning obligations, or other legislative requirements.
Consultation Statement: Document which provides information about the consultation
undertaken and how feedback has been taken into account in preparing the Local Plan. It is
updated at each stage of plan making.
County Wildlife Site (CWS): A non-statutory designation for sites of local importance for
nature conservation interest.
Delivery hubs: Delivery hubs help consolidate deliveries into a smaller number of vehicles
which can help reduce vehicle traffic and enable the onwards last mile delivery by cargo-bike
or electric vehicle.
Densification: Making more efficient use of land, through intensive use of brownfield land,
building taller buildings, building on existing residential back gardens or in-between existing
buildings, or redeveloping underused sites at higher densities.
Design and Access Statement: A statement that accompanies a planning application
to explain the design principles and concepts that have informed the development and
how access issues have been dealt with. The access element of the statement should
demonstrate how the principles of inclusive design, including the specific needs of disabled
people, have been integrated into the proposed development and how inclusion will be
maintained and managed.
Design Code: A set of illustrated design requirements that provide specific, detailed
parameters for the physical development of a site or area. The graphic and written
components of the code should build upon a design vision, such as a masterplan or other
design and development framework for a site or area.
                                                                                     355

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Development: This refers to development in its widest sense, including buildings, and
streets, spaces and places. It also refers to both redevelopment, including refurbishment, as
well as new development.
Digital infrastructure: Infrastructure, such as small cell antenna and ducts for cables,
that supports fixed and mobile connectivity and therefore underpins smart technologies.
District centre: A group of shops, separate from the town centre, usually containing at
least one food supermarket or superstore, and non-retail services such as banks, building
societies and restaurants.
District heat networks: District heating is a system for distributing heat generated in a
centralised location for residential and commercial heating requirements. The heat is often
obtained from a co-generation plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly biomass, although
heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating and central solar heating are also used, as well
as nuclear power.
Downcycling: Downcycling is a recycling practice that involves breaking an item down
into its component elements or materials. Once the constituent elements or materials are
recovered, they are reused if possible but usually as a lower-value product.
Duty to Cooperate Compliance Statement and Statement of Common
Ground: A legal duty to cooperate on plan making, to ensure we have fully engaged with
relevant organisations and considered strategic cross-boundary matters. The engagement
we’ve completed to consider these strategic issues is set out in our Duty to Cooperate
Statement of Compliance, and our current position on each substantive issue is set out in
our draft Statement of Common Ground.
East West Rail: The East West Rail scheme will re-establish a rail link between
Cambridge and Oxford to improve connections between East Anglia and central, southern
and western England. The central section will link Bedford to Cambridge. Further information
is available on the East West Rail company website: https://eastwestrail.co.uk/
Energy masterplanning: Spatial and strategic planning that identifies and develops
opportunities for decentralised energy and the associated technical, financial and legal
considerations that provide the basis for project delivery.
Established Employment Areas in the Countryside: Business parks located in the
rural areas of South Cambridgeshire, outside the Green Belt.
Exception sites: An exception site is a site that provides affordable housing in perpetuity,
provided within or adjoining a rural settlement, as an exception to normal planning policy.
Rural exception sites will be allowed in the Green Belt only when it can be demonstrated that
non Green Belt alternative sites are not available.

First Conversation (Issues and Options): The first stage in preparing the Greater
Cambridge Local Plan, also known as Issues and Options. It set out issues under seven
themes, and posed a series of questions about how they should be addressed in the new
Local Plan.
First Homes: First Homes are a specific kind of discounted market sale housing and
should be considered to meet the definition of ‘affordable housing’ for planning purposes.
Specifically, First Homes are discounted market sale units which:
   a) must be discounted by a minimum of 30% against the market value;
   b) are sold to a person or persons meeting the First Homes eligibility criteria;
   c) on their first sale, will have a restriction registered on the title at HM Land Registry
     to ensure this discount (as a percentage of current market value) and certain other
     restrictions are passed on at each subsequent title transfer; and,
   d) after the discount has been applied, the first sale must be at a price no higher than
      £250,000.
First Proposals (Preferred Options): Also known as Preferred Options, this stage
follows Issues and Options as the next major step in preparing the Greater Cambridge Local
Plan. It sets out the preferred approach to the level of growth that should be planned for,
and where it should be planned, as well as the proposed approach for policies that will be
included in the draft Greater Cambridge Local Plan.
Futureproofing: Ensuring that designs are adaptable and take account of expected future
changes.
Greater Cambridge: The combined areas of Cambridge District and South
Cambridgeshire District Councils.
Greater Cambridge Local Plan: Refers to the join Local Plan being prepared for the
Greater Cambridge area by Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District
Council.
Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP): A partnership between Cambridge City
Council, Cambridgeshire County Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, the
University of Cambridge and the Business Board of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough
Combined Authority to support continued growth of the Greater Cambridge area. Further
information can be found in their webpage: https://www.greatercambridge.org.uk/
Green Belt: A statutory designation for land around certain cities and large built-up
areas, which aims to keep this land permanently open or largely undeveloped, the Green
                                                                                     357

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Belt has five purposes: checking the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; preventing
neighbouring towns from merging into each other; assisting in safeguarding the countryside
from encroachment; preserving the setting and special character of historic towns and
assisting in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.
Specific Green Belt purposes have been set out for Cambridge.
Green Infrastructure: Green Infrastructure is a multi-functional network of public
green spaces and routes, landscapes, biodiversity and heritage. It includes a wide range of
elements such as country parks, wildlife habitats, rights of way, commons and greens, nature
reserves, waterways and bodies of water, and historic landscapes and monuments.
Grow-on space: Premises suitable for small growing businesses.
Health Impact Assessment (HIA): A tool to appraise both positive (e.g. creation
of new jobs) and negative (e.g. generation of pollution) impacts on the different affected
subgroups of the population that might result from the development. Public participation
is considered a major component of the process. It usually assesses a policy or proposal
that does not have health improvement as a primary objective. The implementation
of the development may result in intended objectives being met but may also result in
consequences that are unintended and unanticipated. These unintended effects may be
good or bad for people’s health. An HIA is usually forward-looking (prospective) and done
at a time when it is possible to change the proposed development if necessary, e.g. at the
masterplanning stage.
Healthy New Towns: Healthy towns are those in which people can live and work in
a safe, healthy, supportive and inclusive neighbourhood. A healthy town will ensure that
people are able to enjoy the options of easy access by public transport and active travel
modes (walking and cycling), to services and facilities that are relevant to them. It will also
allow people to safely and easily move around their neighbourhood through high quality
people focused spaces, while enjoying barrier free access to surrounding areas and to the
city centre. They should have safe and easy access to a network of open spaces which
meet their recreational needs to enhance health and wellbeing, as well as welcoming easily
accessible communal spaces which provide opportunities for social interaction.
Heat Island: Urban areas experience higher temperatures than their surrounding rural
areas because of human activities. Materials such as tarmac and stone used in construction
of buildings and roads store heat from the sun during the day and release it during the night.
Heritage assets: A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as
having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its
heritage interest. Heritage asset includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by
the local planning authority (including local listing).

of new manufacturing process or fields of research and other development which may be
regarded as high technology uses.
Higher density: Means new residential and commercial development at a density that is
higher than what is typically found in the surrounding context. It does not mean high density
nor does it translate to high-rise development.
Historic environment: All aspects of the environment resulting from the interaction
between people and places through time, including all surviving physical remains of past
human activity, whether visible, buried or submerged, and landscaped and planted or
managed flora. (Source: NPPF)
Houses in multiple occupation (HMO): An HMO, depending on the number of
occupants, is classed as either: a small HMO – this is a shared dwelling house which is
occupied by between three and six unrelated individuals who share basic amenities such
as a kitchen or bathroom. This falls into use class C4 under the Town and Country Planning
(Use Classes) Order 2010; or a larger HMO – This is when there are more than six unrelated
individuals sharing basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom. This falls into the sui
generis class under the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 2010.
Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF): A government capital grant programme to deliver
new physical infrastructure to support new and existing communities and make more land
available for housing in high demand areas, resulting in new additional homes that otherwise
would not have been built.
Impact Risk Zones: A GIS tool developed by Natural England to make a rapid initial
assessment of the potential risks to Sites of Special Scientific Importance (SSSIs) posed by
development proposals.
Inclusive design: Inclusive design results in an environment which everyone can
use, to access and benefit from the full range of opportunities available; confidently,
independently, with choice and dignity, which avoids separation or segregation and is
made up of places and spaces that acknowledge diversity and difference, meeting the
needs of everyone in society.
Incubator: Provides start-up and scale-up space for companies, including support and
services.
                                                                                     359

is needed, and how much it costs.
Listed Building: Structure considered by the Secretary of State (for Digital, Culture,
Media and Sport) to be ‘of special architectural or historic interest’ and included in a list of
such buildings. The list is maintained by Historic England and is available on-line through the
National Heritage List for England.
Local centre: A cluster of shops and other community facilities that satisfy local needs
and are accessible on foot. Usually comprising a newsagent, a general grocery store, a
sub-post office and occasionally other facilities such as a pharmacy, a public house and a

version is the Greater Cambridge Local Development Scheme 2020.
Local Nature Reserve (LNR): Reserves with wildlife or geological features that are of
special interest locally.
Local Plan: Short form for the Greater Cambridge Local Plan, which sets out policies
to guide the future development of Greater Cambridge. It also sets out where future
development will take place, and identifies land for new housing, community facilities, shops
and employment. It is the key document use to determine planning applications for new
development in the Greater Cambridge area.
Local Planning Authority (LPA): The public authority whose duty it is to carry out
specific planning functions for a particular area; in Greater Cambridge this is Cambridge City
Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council.
Low Emission Strategy: A Low Emission Strategy provides a package of measures
to help mitigate the transport impacts of development. The primary aim is to accelerate the
uptake of low emission fuels and technologies in and around the development site.
Low Emission Zone: A low-emission zone is a defined area where access by some
polluting vehicles is restricted or deterred with the aim of improving air quality. This may
favour vehicles such as alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and
zero-emission vehicles such as all-electric vehicles.
Major development: For housing, development where 10 or more homes will be
provided, or the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more. For non-residential development

it means additional floorspace of 1,000m2 or more, or a site of 1 hectare or more, or
as otherwise provided in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management
Procedure) (England) Order 2015.
Massing: Massing is a term in architecture which refers to the perception of the general
shape and form as well as size of a building.
Masterplan: A masterplan describes how proposals for a site will be implemented.
The level of detail required in a masterplan will vary according to the scale at which the
masterplan is produced.
Meanwhile use: A meanwhile use can be described as a situation where a vacant site or
underused building is used for a duration of time before it is turned into a more permanent
end state, taking advantage of a short window of opportunity. Examples of meanwhile uses
include pop-up shops and cafes, creative workspace and exhibitions, short-term office units,
temporary community meeting places and facilities and temporary housing.
Micro-mobility: Refers to a range of small, lightweight devices operating at speeds
typically below 25 km/h (15mph) and is ideal for trips up to 10km. Micro-mobility devices
include bicycles, E-bikes, electric scooters, electric skateboards, shared bicycles, and
electric pedal assisted (pedelec) bicycles.
Mixed use developments: Development comprising two or more uses as part of the
same scheme (e.g. shops on the ground floor and residential flats above). This could apply
at a variety of scales from individual buildings, to a street, to a new neighbourhood or urban
extension.
Mobility as a Service (MaaS): Mobility as a Service (MaaS) integrates various forms of
transport services into a single mobility service accessible on demand. For the user, MaaS
can offer a single application to provide access to mobility (such as public transport, ride-
, car- or bike-sharing, taxi or car rental) with a single payment channel instead of multiple
ticketing and payment operations. It is designed to help users meet their mobility needs and
solve the inconvenient parts of individual journeys.
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF): This document sets out national
planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. The policies in the
NPPF must be taken into account when preparing Local Plans. www.gov.uk/government/
publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2
National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG): The Government’s Planning
practice guidance to support the NPPF. www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Neighbourhood Plan: A plan prepared by a Parish Council or neighbourhood forum for
a particular neighbourhood area. They must be consistent with the strategic policies in the
current suite of Local Plan documents.
Net zero carbon: Net zero carbon means that carbon emissions cannot exceed zero. In
practice, a net zero carbon target means that in addition to phasing out fossil fuels and the
role of renewable energy and energy reduction measures, there is also a role for balancing a
certain measured amount of carbon released with an amount of carbon offsets, through, for
example, tree planting or carbon capture and storage.
North East Cambridge Area Action Plan: A joint plan being developed by the
Councils for development of the area west of the new Cambridge North train station, together
with Cambridge Science Park. Further information can be found on the Councils website:
https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/north-east-cambridge-area-action-plan
Objectively Assessed Need (OAN): The National Planning Policy Framework requires
that local planning authorities identify objectively assessed housing need (the OAN), and that
Local Plans translate those needs into land provision targets. Like all parts of the plan, such
housing targets should be informed by robust and proportionate evidence.
Older People: People over or approaching retirement age, including the active, newly-
retired through to the very frail elderly; and whose housing needs can encompass
accessible, adaptable general needs housing through to the full range of retirement and
specialised housing for those with support or care needs.
Open space: Areas of land not built on and water bodies such as rivers and lakes,
regardless of ownership and access. These areas include parks and gardens; natural and
semi-natural green spaces; green corridors; outdoor sports facilities; amenity green space;
teenagers’ and children’s play areas; allotments and community gardens; cemeteries and
churchyards; accessible countryside in urban fringe areas and civic spaces.
Opportunity Areas: Provide opportunities to enable development that can reinforce
and create character and identity in key corridors and centres of the city, often through
associated public realm improvements. Given the opportunity nature of these sites they
do not include any particular levels of development and are not counted towards meeting
our needs.
Outline Planning Permission / Approval: Outline planning permission is much less
detailed than full planning permission. By applying for it, you are asking the local planning
authority to agree to the principle of development – with the specifics (called “reserved
matters”) put aside until later.

Oxford-Cambridge Arc: An area covering Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge,
identified by the Government as a unique opportunity to become an economic asset of
international standing.
Passivhaus: Passivhaus buildings provide a high level of occupant comfort while using
very little energy for heating and cooling. They are designed and constructed according to
principles developed by the Passivhaus Institute in Germany.
Permitted Development Rights: Permitted development rights are a national grant of
planning permission which allow certain building works and changes of use to be carried out
without having to make a planning application. Permitted development rights are subject to
conditions and limitations to control impacts and to protect local amenity.
Planning Condition: A condition imposed on a grant of planning permission (in
accordance with the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) or a condition included in a Local
Development Order or Neighbourhood Development Order.
Planning Obligation: A legally enforceable obligation entered into under section 106 of
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal.
Policy Area: Policy outlining planning requirements for a specific area or site. This can
include allocation for certain types of development or imposing restrictions for particular
types of uses.
Previously developed land: Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure,
including the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be assumed that the
whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure.
This excludes: land that is or was last occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings; land that
has been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal by landfill, where provision for
restoration has been made through development management procedures; land in built-up
areas such as residential gardens, parks, recreation grounds and allotments; and land that
was previously developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface
structure have blended into the landscape.
Private Rented Sector (PRS): Housing Build to Rent: Purpose built housing that is
typically 100% rented out. It can form part of a wider multi-tenure development comprising
either flats or houses, but should be on the same site and/or contiguous with the main
development. Schemes will usually offer longer tenancy agreements of three years
or more, and will typically be professionally managed stock in single ownership and
management control.
Productivity: Being able to produce or provide goods and services.
                                                                                      363

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
Public open spaces: Any land laid out as a public garden or used for the purposes of
public recreation. This means space which has unimpeded public access, and which is of
a suitable size and nature for sport, active or passive recreation or children and teenagers’
play. Private or shared amenity areas, for example in a development of flats, or buffer
landscaped areas are not included as public open space. This definition relates to both
open space provided within a development, and when considering the provision of existing
open space.
Public realm: Public realm relates to all those parts of the built environment where the
public has free access. It encompasses: all streets, squares, and other rights of way, whether
predominantly in residential, commercial or community/civic uses; the open spaces and
parks; and the ‘public/private’ spaces where public access is unrestricted (at least during
daylight hours). It includes the interfaces with key internal and private spaces to which
the public normally has free access. (Source: ODPM in Living Places: Caring for Quality
(January 2004)).
Registered Provider: Registered Provider means a provider of Affordable Housing
which is designated in the register maintained by the Homes and Communities Agency.
The statutory register of social housing providers lists private (non-profit and profit-making)
providers and local authority providers. Most non-profit providers are also known as housing
associations.
Renewable and low carbon energy: Includes energy for heating and cooling as well
as generating electricity. Renewable energy covers those energy flows that occur naturally
and repeatedly in the environment – from the wind, the fall of water, the movement of
the oceans, from the sun and also from biomass and deep geothermal heat. Low carbon
technologies are those that can help reduce emissions (compared to conventional use of
fossil fuels).
Research and Development (R&D): Sector within industry specialising in researching
new ideas and developing these products towards being made.
Section 106 (S106): A binding legal agreement requiring a developer or landowner to
provide or contribute towards facilities, infrastructure or other measures, in order for planning
permission to be granted. Planning obligations are normally secured under Section 106 of
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Self or custom build: The terms ‘self-build’ and ‘custom build’ are used where
individuals or groups are involved in creating their own home. Community-led projects can
also be defined as self-build. Self-build projects are defined as those where someone directly
organises the design and construction of their own home. Custom build homes are where
you work with a developer as an individual or a group to help deliver your own home. The

developer may help to find a plot, manage the construction and arrange the finance for your
new home. This is more of a hands-off approach but your home will be tailored to match your
individual requirements.
Skyline: An outline of land and buildings defined against the sky: the skyline of the city.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): The UK government definition of
SMEs encompasses small (less than 50 employees and an annual turnover under €10
million) and medium-sized (less than 250 employees and an annual turnover under €50
million) businesses. Micro enterprises have less than 10 employees and an annual turnover
under €2 million.
Smart energy grid: A smart grid is a modernised electricity grid that uses information and
communications technology to monitor and actively control generation and demand in near
real-time, which provides a more reliable and cost-effective system for transporting electricity
from generators to homes, business and industry.
Smart technology: The Smart Cambridge project defines what makes a smart city on
their website: Digital technology underpins almost every aspect of modern living across work,
travel, leisure and health. Smart cities technology builds on this, using digital connectivity
and data in innovative ways to address city challenges in four key areas:
    ■  Transport: making travel easier, reducing congestion, and exploring intelligent mobility
    ■  Environment: managing our water, energy, air quality and waste
    ■  Healthcare: catering for an ageing population and providing public health
    ■  Smart living: improving the quality of life for communities in and around the city.
Southern Cluster: A knowledge-based cluster of businesses in technology, biotechnology
and service providers, located to the south of Cambridge between the M11 and the A1307.
Stakeholder: A person, group or organisation that has interest in planning for the area.
Standard Method: A government formula that helps councils to work out how many
homes are needed in a given local area. Details of the standard method can be found
on the government’s ‘planning guidance - Housing and economic needs assessment’
website: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-and-economic-development-needs-
assessments
Start-up: The early stage of a new business.
Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace standards (SANGs): SANG is the
name given to greenspace that is of a quality and type suitable for use as mitigation to offset
the impact of new residential development on European protected Natura 2000 sites; Special
Protection Areas (SPAs) and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). The purpose of SANG
                                                                                    365

Greater Cambridge Local Plan First Proposals
is to provide an alternative greenspace to attract residents of new developments away from
the protected and vulnerable sites.
Sustainability Appraisal (SA): Prepared alongside the draft plan to appraise the social,
environmental and economic effects of a plan and alternative approaches to help ensure that
decisions made will contribute to achieving sustainable development.
Sustainable Development: Development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDs): Development normally reduces the amount
of water that can infiltrate into the ground and increases surface water run-off due to the
amount of hard surfacing used. Sustainable drainage systems control surface water run-off
by mimicking natural drainage processes through the use of surface water storage areas,
flow limiting devices and the use of infiltration areas or soakaways. Sustainable modes of
transport Any efficient, safe and accessible means of transport with overall low impact on the
environment, including walking and cycling, low and ultra-low emission vehicles, car sharing
and public transport.
Total Energy Use Intensity (TEUI): Provides a measure of a building’s total energy
use per square metre of building area per year (kWh/m2/yr).
Townscape: Townscape is the landscape within the built-up area, including the buildings,
the relationship between them, the different types of urban open spaces, including green
spaces and the relationship between buildings and open spaces.
Transport Assessment: A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out
transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies measures required to
improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car
such as walking, cycling and public transport, and measures that will be needed deal with
the anticipated transport impacts of the development.
Travel Plan: A long-term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to
deliver sustainable transport objectives and is regularly reviewed.
Use Classes Order: The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as
amended) puts uses of land and buildings into various categories known as use classes.
Planning permission is not needed when both the present and proposed uses fall within the
same class. The General Permitted Development Order also allows some changes from one
use class to another without the need for planning permission.

Walkable (neighbourhood): Areas typically based on 400m (five-minute walking
time) catchments. The Urban Design Compendium (2000) Paragraph 3.1.2 describes the
principles of ‘The Walkable Neighbourhood’, describing what facilities should be within a five-
and ten-minute walk from home.
Whole Life Carbon Assessment (WLC): The carbon emissions resulting from the
materials, construction and the use of a building over its entire life, including its demolition
and disposal. A WLC assessment provides a true picture of a building’s carbon impact on the
environment.
Windfall development: Sites which have not been specifically identified as available for
development in the Local Plan. They normally comprise previously developed sites that have
unexpectedly become available.
Zero carbon development: Zero carbon development is development that results in no
net emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
